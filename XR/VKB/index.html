<h2><a href=https://www.vkbcontrollers.com/products/gladiator-nxt-evo-space-combat-edition-right-hand>VKB NXT EVO SCE R</a> HOTAS</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Mostly preferred over Microsoft SideWinder Precision 2 for use as SteamVR controller by XInput emulation
<dd>NXT EVO SCE has more buttons and can be configured to approximate XInput trigger axes.
<br>- I wish analog mini and 8-way hat controls were separate;
<br> &emsp; in VR, no way to tell which is toggled.
<br>- unlike analog mini stick, grip centering cam action still applies when away from center
<br>- single action button for pinky finger is IMO too low
<br>- center 5-way hat button (6-10) IMO is the only one with helpful shape;
<br> &emsp; upper right hat (11-15) shape is nearly so poor as lower left.
<br>- lower left 5-way hat button for thumb (16-20) is IMO too close; ridged cup shape is clumsy;
<br> &emsp; too easily pressed down when wanting other direction

<dt><br><b>Not great onboarding</b>
<dd>Much essential information is by crappy YouTube videos.
<br> - <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRC5uPpFPzk><b>NXT EVO Quick Guide 2024</b></a> screen view is too low resolution
<br> - <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRC5uPpFPzk&t=180s>plugging the grip connector into the base at 3:00/9:42</a> is very unclear
<dd> - pausing and resuming <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTZNUT8wmOA><b>NXT and NXT EVO flashing and calibrating</b> video</a>
<br> &emsp; is a lousy way to follow that convoluted procedure
<dd><br><a href=https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0551/4739/7238/files/Njoy32_2_19_En.pdf><b>NJoy32 Family Controllers Configuration Utility</b> User guide</a>
<br> - mostly a poorly organized <i>specification</i>, sometimes unreadable and oftem inscruitable.
<br> - rarely does it actually <i>guide readers</i> to accomplish anything useful.
<dd> - "Logical", "physical" and "virtual" terms are sprinkled thru the PDF without ever being defined,
<br> &emsp; much less how elements with those attributes interact.
<dd> - floundering in horrid <a href=https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0551/4739/7238/files/VKBDevCfg-C_v0.93.26.zip>VKBDevCfg Device Configurator</a>
app occastionally provokes <font color = red>RTFM</font> dialog box,
<br> &emsp;  so VKB is at least aware that theirs is just another <font color = red>FM</font>, not really <font color = green><b>user guide</b></font>...
<dd> - Example of <i>useless</i> specification: &nbsp; Page 102 <b>Access from Physical layer tab</b>
<pre>   In order to apply logical function click logical function sign as shown on a picture.</pre>
&emsp; No idea what a "logical function sign" looks like...
<dd> - Example of <i>doomed</i> specification:&nbsp firmware upgrade (2.2, pages 20-22)
<br> &emsp; failed, leaving HOTAS not updated and unuseable until unplugging and replugging its USB

<dt><br><a href=Config.htm#triggers><b>simulate XInput analog triggers</b></a>
<dd>by so-called trim switches...
<pre>
Trimming is fine tuning a rotation axis without using the joystick.
It's used to adjust pitch, yaw or/and roll
so during flight you could just release the joystick (or hold it at rest)
and maintain course (or climb, descent, turn etc) by trimming.
</pre>
<dt>"physical" axes 7 and 8 are not associated with physical controls, so <code>Virtual</code> (not logical?) inputs
<dd>Trimmer must be enabled to control them from buttons...
<dd>Trimmer by buttons is at 4.3.19 (pg 84) in PDF

<dt><a href=http://forum.vkb-sim.pro/viewtopic.php?t=8372>Button to axis</a> (VKB forum)
<dd>TRIMMER SET 2 in Button Mapping Wizard may be necessary, but does not suffice;
<br>perhaps something involving <i>logical</i> is wantedr?

<dt>logical axis
<dd>Single physical axis can bind to several logical axes.

<pre>Technically, the trimmer reset function works exactly that way
...just sets the axis value to 0 (50%) instead of any other value.
Trimmer Set and Set2 will trim the center to an arbitrary value
Fix Axes > FA3 will freeze the (logical I believe) axis in  place
at an arbitrary value set on the profile > axes page
</pre>
<dt>Trigger has 2 switches
<dd>full squeeze turns on both
<br>for trim use, probably want second switch to disable first
