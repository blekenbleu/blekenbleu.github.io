<h2>VR1 quality check</h2>
My VR1 arrived with no physical flaws,<br>
but at least two other customers had one lens module out of position,<br>
reducing IPD range and impacting ability to center pupils.<br>
<img src="IPD.jpg"></p>
That could result from dropping VR1's shipping carton flat on one side.<br>
This is something each customer should check immediately when unpacking.

<h3>My initial impressions</h3>
My VR1 usage is nearly all in SteamVR and trouble-free, except:
<ul>
<li>VR1 restarts are often required for UltraLeap to be recognized.
<li>My face does not fit VR1, but I consider that their design choice, not a quality issue.
<br> &nbsp; Removing VR1's face mask and installing a <a href=../strap.htm>BOBOVR M2</a> addressed that.
<li>Not enough FoV to replace a pair of 30-inch monitors for programming; 
<br>peak clarity over only FoV center half.
<li>VR1 is more front-heavy than other headsets,
<br> but I think this is more noticed with BOBOVR..
<li>VR1 probably has among the shortest focal distances,
<br> which is problematic for many users over 35;
<br> &emsp; a pair of prescription VROptician inserts are often wanted.
</ul>

<h3>Issues cited <i>by others</i></h3><dl>
<dt>random "robotic" microphone sound issue
<dt>eye tracking issues
<dd>I suspect drooping eyelids and pupils not in eyeboxes.
<br>I have strong prescription inserts with substantial prism without eye tracking issues.
<dt>VR1 may be folks' first accessory placing serious demands on their PC;
<br>blaming VR1 for problematic operation is often IMO wrong-headed.
<dd>Far too many motherboards have crap USB implementations,
<br>both for EMC and thruput.&nbsp; I suspect this more from AMD than Intel chipsets.
<dt>AMD GPUs do not (yet) work.
<dd>Many Nvidia drivers are problematic with VR1;&nbsp; <i>latest often not the best</i>.
<dt>Until 15 Sep 2025, VR1 Tool is neither user friendly nor robust.
<dd>Some files installed for other headsets (WMR, Pimax, Varjo) can torpedo VR1.
<dt>Trying to use maximum frame rate and resolution is doomed.
<dd>Using unsupported software (OXRTK) and complaining is silly.
<dt>Somnium lacks a <i><b>consolidated</b></i> <a href=../Somnium_VR1_sources.htm>VR1 information source</a>

<h3>Shodah settings, suggestions</h3><ul>
<li>Optimizations for windows games is disabled
<li>GPU scheduling is enabled
<li>Nvidia Control panel, Texture filter - Quality set to High-Performance
<li>Nvidia Control panel, power managment mode set to Prefer maximum performance
</ul>
Try enabling and disabling direct mode when in SteamVR,<br>
 also turn off OpenXR and see if SteamVR works.
