<h2>First real world VR1 customers - impressions, software and hiccups</h2>
<dl><dt>"VrgEyes -Could not initialize camera stream"
<dd>Three 10gig (red) USB ports wanted
<ul><li>MR cameras share one USB cable, but use 2 ports..!</ul>

<dt><br>[vrg_eyes] [critical] [VrgEyesApi.cpp:274] VRG EYES API (StartIpdCalibrationUsingTool)<br>
- camera error: EyeCamMediaFoundationStitched - BOTH: Failed to create video capture device.
<dd>known bug in VR1 <i>SteamVR</i> driver eye tracking IPD measurement<ul>
<li>should not interfere with usability
<li>OpenXR eye tracking should work nominally</ul>

<dt><br><font size=+2><b>some initial impressions</b></font>
<dt>"Sharpness is really good, colors and brightness also, weight is ok for me,<br>
<dd>I will have to work a bit on comfort (but that was the case with every HMD I had so far)"<br><br>

<dt>"No power button just like Aero? Oof. Good thing I already have smart plugs in place<br>
 <dd>I had some major tracking issues (jumping all over the place for no reason)<br>
 OK got the tracking working, Varjo Base was still installed, that probably messed with it<br>
 In WIMFOV, it loads (via steam VR) and I see the mirror. I also see base stations are tracking fine.<br>
 But the headset won't wake when I put it in, screens are off, LEDs are on..?" &nbsp
 (<i>SteamVR VS OpenXR</i>)<br>
 ... seems my tracking issues was a problematic basestation
I just tried adding studioform counterweights and Pimax Crystal cushion<br>
 and this has improved comfort by a lot,<br>
I'm lucky as I don't really plan on using steamVR much,<br>
but it's completely unusable due to the "delay" issue.<br>
If i disable steamVR and use only openXR everything runs great<br>
and BTW what is Brightness Correction?
"<br><br>

<dt>"I am officially second ü•à in the entire planet earth üòÉ‚òùÔ∏è<br>
 <dd>Wonder if that line is intended or damaged xD<br>
 <img align=top src=line.jpg> &nbsp
 (<i>they print with layers. Sometimes it happens.</i>)<br>
 Omg Guys that custom cable is something else üî•üî•üî•Literally the best cable I've seen<br> 
 While installing the driver I am looking at vr1,<br>
 a magnesium head strap would be more appropriate to such a super super high-end headset.<br>
 Okay picture is beyond phenomenal BUT, your brain needs to adjust<br>
 There is some kind of delay between head movement. Like 40ms perhaps which makes you a little bit dizzy<br>
 like remember guys when you mod the HTC Vive pro 1 with gear vr lenses.<br>
 You had that dizzy pressure feeling in the brain that something ain't right &nbsp
 (<i>lag from HDR setting</i>)<br>
 It's I guess aspherics I didn't use them for 3 years ...  But holy cow that fov üò±üòçüòçüòç<br>
 Manual [IPD] works but the change doesn't apply in the software (<i>Known bug</i>)<br>
 <img src=800705aa.jpg><br>
 I got a 3500&euro; monitor with 12 bit that's why it didn't work with VR1<br>
 Yeah need a much thinner facial interface mask<br>
 So far I found out that the headset has to be at 90hz at 60% resolution so you have 3ms response time<br>
 otherwise you will have the feeling that it's sluggish. The LCD panels are slow in the vr1 as with varjo Aero.<br>
 It ain't HTC Vive pro 1 quickness. I think that's what we feel.<br>
 Hopefully 120hz next week that will reduce the latency.<br>
 (<i>tracking issues</i>) Had that too but restarted the PC and everything was fine.<br>
 First launch vr1 software then steam VR"<br><br>

<dt>"DAS anchors‚ô•Ô∏è<dd><img src=DAS.jpg><br>
 Guess which cable is from VR1 and which index<br><img src=cables.jpg><br>
 Instead of a power brick I would have preferred one of those where all the weight is at the Socket<br>
 and the cable is all light all the way &nbsp But its good enough<br>
 <i><b>Feedback</b></i>: &nbsp at the ultraleap step it said 'drivers not installed',<br>
 &emsp; but didn't give me a button to install it, only a next.<br>
 &emsp; later in the software under the drivers tab could I click it<br>
my extension cable might not be proper<br>
for reference, the hd800s don't really fit. but these are gigantic headphones<br>
 <div align=center><img width=300 src=hd800.jpg></div>
I think I have 1 [base station] that behaves worse then the other 3.<br>
I'll disable it and see if it makes a difference<br>
Skyrim just gave me a black screen but I did hear sound<br>
Pavlov is still completely broken.<br>
Alyx is playable but I need to dial in some settings, and perhaps turn of my ultrawide screen.<br>
Bladed and sorcery seemed to work mostly fine<br>
Untill you fall as well.<br>
I had all [Alyx] settings lowest, didn't see any resolution option though<br>
I also don't know what the relation is between the resolution setting in steamvr vs in the vr1 app
"
<br><br>
 
<dt>"what was the fix for tracking latency again? I'm feeling sick<br>
<dd>everytime when i try to start SteamVR and I haven't just restarted the pc<br>
it says it can't track the headset and in the headset it's just a one tone color across the whole screen<br>
it only shows up the first time i open steamVR after i restart the pc,<br> when i close it and restart it it stops working<br>
The image seen on display seems to be slightly delayed to my movements.<br>
 I disabled gsync, set my monitor to 8bit color,<br>
 made sure that I'm using the closest displayport to the mainboard, still the same.<br>
 I'm getting 20-30fps with 80% in vrc"<br><br>

<dd><img src=setup.jpg>

<dt><br>Update to latest Nvidia driver before plugging in VR1;
<dd>ignore message about downgrading that driver.

 for RTX 4090 and VR tracking input lag

<br><br><dt><font size=+2><b>hiccups</b></font>
<dt>First 2 customers reported nausea-inducing lags;&nbsp work-around:
<dd><ul><li>PLUG VR1 INTO RTX 4090 "MAIN DISPLAY PORT" (nearest motherboard)
<li>disable G-Sync and 12 bit in Nvidia resolution settings</ul>

<dt><br>Varjo Base may interfere with VR1 tracking

<dt><br>Resolution slides shows 0x0 resolution when SteamVR is off

<dt><br>One tip that might be useful.
<dd>When running Steam VR, always start VR first from Steam,<br>
 then the application (especially with MSFS) the performance seems much better,<br>
 especially with head movement smoothness.
