<h2>First VR1 customers - hints, software, impressions and hiccups</h2>
<dl>
<dt><br><b><i>Flash news</i></b>:&nbsp; <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDRlksSJLos>lag is caused by NVIDIA driver changes</a>.
<dd>team is working on changes right now.<br>
<i>First customer version of</i> VR1 tool <i>works only with new drivers</i><br>
So after Friday [1 Nov] everything will work as intended, including <i>much</i> wider FoV etc.<br>
FOV and warping will change, based on 'wrong warping' identified yesterday (30 Oct).

<dt><br>One tip that might be useful.
<dd>When running Steam VR, always start VR first from Steam,<br>
 then the application (especially with MSFS) the performance seems much better,<br>
 especially with head movement smoothness.

<dt><br>SteamVR IPD
<dd>Open the developer console by first pressing the three-lined menu button at the top of SteamVR,<br>
 then decending into the Developer menu section, and finally selecting the Web Console.<br>
 This will navigate your browser to a SteamVR served webpage that lets you access the console.<br>
 Alternatively you can navigate to <a href=http://localhost:27062/console/index.html>this link (while SteamVR is running)</a>.<br>
 From there, enter the command:&nbsp <code>settings steamvr.ipd</code><br>
 and that should return your IPD in meters. Eg. <code>steamvr.ipd: 0.063</code> for an IPD of 63mm.

<a name=first><dt></a>"Sharpness is really good, colors and brightness also, weight is ok for me,<br>
<dd>I will have to work a bit on comfort (but that was the case with every HMD I had so far)<br>
 Visonary weight (without headstrap but with anchorpoint) of 645g<br>
 Windows 11, AMD 5800x3d X570 msi motherboard<br>
 I don't have a 12 bit monitor, can only set 8bit (monitor; VR1 now showing in nvidia panel)<br>
 Main monitor is already 1080p/60Hz<br>
 BTW about the USB issue with eye tracking;<br>
 I checked and I did already use USB3.2 gen 2 which should suffice.<br>
 I'm using 5800x3d/X570, I know there has been some history with usb on amd and vr,<br>
 maybe there is som issue? Also, could it be related to the tracking/distortion issue?<br>
 I think eye relief change works real-time but the rendering needs some seconds to adjust<br>
 and the image freezes a few secs<br>
 I've now tried to alter settings in the 'tracking' tab and none of these seem to have any effect.<br>
 Also tried the 'motion compensation' with a vive tracker, also no effect<br>
 Tried with version 555.99. No difference.<br>
 The version mentioned in installer (546.01) I cannot find at nvidia website<br>
 I tried now a few more apps (HL ALyx, MSFS2020, Eurotruck Sim2, automobilista 2,<br>
 a few UEVR (Talos Principle2, Ride5 with openXR).<br>
 The delay issue seems to be more prominent in SteamVR.<br>
 With openXR I did notice it less, but it still was noticable.<br>
 Of course it also depends on the content, with HL Alyx its probably most noticable<br>
 I think I can now see (with nvidia version 555.99) what was meant by the 'screen tearing'.<br>
 I see a vertical line in the left eye at the right edge. Will upgrade to latest driver again<br>
 Just resetted the 3D settings in the nvidia driver panel, also didn't change anything<br>
  I see lag also in SteamVR home, in the 'virtual desktop' of the VR1 software, in testHmd,<br>
 basically everywhere so I'm pretty sure it doesn't depend on the app or an app specific setting"

<dt><br>"I am officially second ü•à in the entire planet earth üòÉ‚òùÔ∏è<br>
 <dd>Wonder if that line is intended or damaged xD<br>
 <img align=top src=line.jpg> &nbsp
 (<i>printed in bands; sometimes it happens.</i>)<br>
 Omg Guys that custom cable is something else üî•üî•üî•Literally the best cable I've seen<br> 
 While installing the driver I am looking at vr1,<br>
 a magnesium head strap would be more appropriate to such a super super high-end headset.<br>
 Okay picture is beyond phenomenal BUT, your brain needs to adjust<br>
 There is some kind of delay between head movement.<br>
 Like 40ms perhaps which makes you a little bit dizzy<br>
 ... that dizzy pressure feeling in the brain that something ain't right &nbsp
 (<i>lag from HDR setting</i>)<br>
 It's I guess aspherics I didn't use them for 3 years ...  But holy cow that fov üò±üòçüòçüòç<br>
 Manual [IPD] works but the change doesn't apply in the software (<i>Known bug</i>)<br>
 <img src=800705aa.jpg><br>
 I got a 3500&euro; monitor with 12 bit that's why it didn't work with VR1<br>
 Yeah need a much thinner facial interface mask<br>
 So far I found out that the headset has to be at 90hz at 60% resolution<br>
 so you have 3ms response time otherwise you will have the feeling that it's sluggish.<br>
 The LCD panels are slow in the vr1 as with varjo Aero.<br>
 It ain't HTC Vive pro 1 quickness. I think that's what we feel.<br>
 Hopefully 120hz next week that will reduce the latency.<br>
 (<i>tracking issues</i>) Had that too but restarted the PC and everything was fine.<br>
 First launch vr1 software then steam VR"

<dt><br>"No power button just like Aero? Oof. Good thing I already have smart plugs in place<br>
 <dd>Do the panels autonpower off and if yes can the timeout time be adjusted?<br>
 Clicked through the wizard but it didn't trigger any tracking setup.<br>
 Didn't the first time either BTW. Just installed steamVR drivers<br>
 I had some major tracking issues (jumping all over the place for no reason)<br>
 OK got the tracking working, Varjo Base was still installed, that probably messed with it<br>
 In WIMFOV, it loads (via steam VR) and I see the mirror, and base stations are tracking fine.<br>
 Headset won't wake when put on; screens are off, LEDs are on..? &nbsp
 (<i>SteamVR VS OpenXR</i>)<br>
 Has anyone used OXRTK successfully yet? I disabled it earlier because it wasn't "in the right place".<br>
 It was at a weird distance and angle to me so I couldn't even read the text.<br>
 It seemed to be functional but not usable due to the weird positioning<br>
 Will try again now<br>
 ... Aaand MSFS crashed when trying to enter VR. Never had as many MSFS crashes as today<br>
 Not sure what causes this, but sometimes the resolution slide will display 0x0.<br>
 Moving the slider doesn't help.<br>
 <img src=resolution.jpg><br>
 Having said all this, the image sharpness and colors are absolutely STUNNING<br>
 when it's working somewhat. &nbsp
 Crazy contrast too. And lenses also much better than Crystal Light<br>
 And comfort feels pretty great too, although I haven't worn it long.<br>
 Feels a lot like the Aero in many respects (also visually),<br>
 which is NOT a bad thing from my perspective, was actually just what I wanted.<br>
 Really hope all the kinks can be ironed out!<br>
 Q3 and pro both have better e2e clarity, but that's expected. Or rather, their clarity extends further,<br>
 right to the very edge of the lense. In V1 there is some blurryness at the edges<br>
 I just cranked the resolution to 110% in MSFS and DAMN. now I see why we need 5090s. Nuts<br>
 NICE I got OXRTK working, simply needed to start it in safe mode<br>
 I dunno, details in the distance seem a lot more pixelated with this setting<br>
 than at equivalent resolutuons on PCL or Aero, maybe due to the larger FOV. BUt I'm still tweaking<br>
 Default FOV so far... just trying to establish basic operations..<br>
 I really want it to work but there is some weird issue<br>
 where OXRTK menu moves to an inaccessible place when not running it in safe mode.<br>
 Not sure if this is a VR1 problem but I've never had it before.<br>
 And it does offer some things that the VR1 tool doesn't over<br>
 like turbo mode and CAS sharpening and in-VR fps display<br>
 you can disable steamVR and the tracking still works<br>
 (still via steamVR, but in background only. SteamVR app is not open)<br>
 I'm beginning to think that<br>
 <i><b>MSFS crashes if VR1 tool is open and VR1 is connected while MSFS loads</b></i>.<br>
 But if I let it load first and then connect the HMD it seems fine+<br>
 At least i got OXRTK working properly by activating Legacy Menu mode, thanks to whoever said that!<br><br>

 ... seems my tracking issues was a problematic basestation<br>
 I just tried adding studioform counterweights and Pimax Crystal cushion<br>
 and this has improved comfort by a lot,<br>
 I'm lucky as I don't really plan on using steamVR much,<br>
 but it's completely unusable due to the 'delay' issue.<br>
 If i disable steamVR and use only openXR everything runs great<br>
 and BTW what is Brightness Correction?
 Even openXR via steamVR has the [lag] issue I think.<br>
 I can fix it by disabling steamVR in the VR1 tool and rebooting,<br>
 then running via Somnium OXR runtime only<br>
 3D effect is great<br>
 I had 2 instances when entering VR where the left panel simply didn't switch on<br>
 Leaving and entering VR again fixed it both times &nbsp (<i>this is a software glitch</i>)<br>
 How do you deal with the steamVR menu that appears within MSFS<br>
 when using that runtime? I couldn't handle it lol<br>
 just added the Apache strap on top of the counterweights and the Studioform Cushion<br>
 and now it's comfortable as hell, better than Aero actually üëç<br>
 But long test (1.5hrs+) still to be done<br>
 Basically, when looking at a super stable "object" like a menu<br>
 or a stationary plane in MSFS and moving head left to right,<br>
 a "wave/ripple" like distortion moves through the field of view very near the center.<br>
 There is even a point when what you are focusing on<br>
 seems to "shift/materialize" a small distance from the left to the right.<br>
 Once you see it you can't unsee it. <br>
 In addition, I can't seem to fully focus on most of the screen, and this is not due to my eyesight.<br>
 I don't have this issue in other headsets. <br>
 Any idea why the eye relief is disabled for me? Does it only work in steamVR mode?<br>
 <img src=relief.png><br>
 Anyone who already has one, try this: Look at a menu text and close your left eye,<br>
 then slowly move your head left to right and back and forth slowly. Is the text entirely stable?<br><br>

 When I look through my left eye only, it's basically stable. When I look through my right eye only,<br>
 I see very obvious warping/rippling and even see the text "telelport" a few milimetres."

<dt><br>"DAS anchors‚ô•Ô∏è<dd><img src=DAS.jpg><br>
 Guess which cable is from VR1 and which index<br><img src=cables.jpg><br>
 Instead of a power brick I would have preferred one of those where all the weight is at the Socket<br>
 and the cable is all light all the way &nbsp But its good enough<br>
 <i><b>Feedback</b></i>: &nbsp at the ultraleap step it said 'drivers not installed',<br>
 &emsp; but didn't give me a button to install it, only a next.<br>
 &emsp; later in the software under the drivers tab could I click it<br>
 my extension cable might not be proper<br>
 for reference, the hd800s don't really fit. but these are gigantic headphones<br>
 <div align=center><img width=300 src=hd800.jpg></div>
 I think I have 1 [base station] that behaves worse then the other 3.<br>
 I'll disable it and see if it makes a difference<br>
 Skyrim just gave me a black screen but I did hear sound<br>
 Pavlov is still completely broken.<br>
 Alyx is playable but I need to dial in some settings, and perhaps turn of my ultrawide screen.<br>
 Bladed and sorcery seemed to work mostly fine<br>
 Untill you fall as well.<br>
 I had all [Alyx] settings lowest, didn't see any resolution option though<br>
 I also don't know what the relation is between the resolution setting in steamvr vs in the vr1 app"
 
<dt><br>"what was the fix for tracking latency again? I'm feeling sick<br>
<dd>everytime when i try to start SteamVR and I haven't just restarted the pc<br>
 it says it can't track the headset and in the headset<br>
 it's just a one tone color across the whole screen<br>
 it only shows up the first time i open steamVR after i restart the pc,<br>
 when i close it and restart it it stops working<br>
 The image seen on display seems to be slightly delayed to my movements.<br>
 I disabled gsync, set my monitor to 8bit color,<br>
 made sure that I'm using the closest displayport to the mainboard, still the same.<br>
 I'm getting 20-30fps with 80% in vrc"

<dt><br>"So, after I came home today, for me it was now the first time,<br>
<dd> installing and using the VR1 Ultimate Edition üôÇ<br>
  And oh, boy, it's a lot of USB cables üòÇ  And Artur,<br>
 you are crazy to make also the USB cable housing out of metal üò¨<br>
 <img src=lot.jpg><br>
 I had not much time to test a lot of the functionality in much detail.<br>
 At the beginning, the Ultraleap Module was not recognized.<br>
 After plugging the power off and on again,<br>
 I was able to also install the Ultraleap Module, which is working now üëç<br>
 Unfortunately, at the beginning I've also got some connection errors for the Mixed Reality Cameras,<br>
 but now they are also working. In my room it's a little bit dark,<br>
 but in Passthrough I was able to see everything and was able to read text on paper without issues.<br>
 Similar to Pico 4 passthrough, mixed realized cameras got very blurry<br>
 during head movement.&nbsp (<i>turn up the frame rate on the cameras</i>)<br>
 If you stand still, amazing sharp camera picture!<br>
 Regarding Visual in SteamVR, yes, the picture is super sharp,<br> if you stand still and not moving the head.<br>
 But yes, due to the current software issue,<br> the VR1 and using VR experience is impossible in this state.<br>
 Everything feels like you are moving in slowmotion, and you are getting dizzy after short time<br>
 So let's wait until the next software release,<br>
 to start the next first testing procedure and hopefully able to use VR in a normal way"
