<dt><br>SteamVR IPD
<dd>Open the developer console by first pressing the three-lined menu button at the top of SteamVR,<br>
 then decending into the Developer menu section, and finally selecting the Web Console.<br>
 This will navigate your browser to a SteamVR served webpage that lets you access the console.<br>
 Alternatively you can navigate to <a href=http://localhost:27062/console/index.html>this link (while SteamVR is running)</a>.<br>
 From there, enter the command:&nbsp <code>settings steamvr.ipd</code><br>
 and that should return your IPD in meters. Eg. <code>steamvr.ipd: 0.063</code> for an IPD of 63mm.

 &emsp; <i>issues mostly addressed; &nbsp some pupil swim complaints</i><br><br>

<a name=first><dt></a><details><summary>"Sharpness is really good, colors and brightness also,
 weight is ok for me,</summary>>
<dd>I will have to work a bit on comfort (but that was the case with every HMD I had so far)<br>
 Visonary weight (without headstrap but with anchorpoint) of 645g<br>
 Windows 11, AMD 5800x3d X570 msi motherboard<br>
 I don't have a 12 bit monitor, can only set 8bit (monitor; VR1 now showing in nvidia panel)<br>
 Main monitor is already 1080p/60Hz<br>
 BTW about the USB issue with eye tracking;<br>
 I checked and I did already use USB3.2 gen 2 which should suffice.<br>
 I'm using 5800x3d/X570, I know there has been some history with usb on amd and vr,<br>
 maybe there is som issue? Also, could it be related to the tracking/distortion issue?<br>
 I think eye relief change works real-time but the rendering needs some seconds to adjust<br>
 and the image freezes a few secs<br>
 I've now tried to alter settings in the 'tracking' tab and none of these seem to have any effect.<br>
 Also tried the 'motion compensation' with a vive tracker, also no effect<br>
 Tried with version 555.99. No difference.<br>
 The version mentioned in installer (546.01) I cannot find at nvidia website<br>
 I tried now a few more apps (HL ALyx, MSFS2020, Eurotruck Sim2, automobilista 2,<br>
 a few UEVR (Talos Principle2, Ride5 with openXR).<br>
 The delay issue seems to be more prominent in SteamVR.<br>
 With openXR I did notice it less, but it still was noticable.<br>
 Of course it also depends on the content, with HL Alyx its probably most noticable<br>
 I think I can now see (with nvidia version 555.99) what was meant by the 'screen tearing'.<br>
 I see a vertical line in the left eye at the right edge. Will upgrade to latest driver again<br>
 Just resetted the 3D settings in the nvidia driver panel, also didn't change anything<br>
  I see lag also in SteamVR home, in the 'virtual desktop' of the VR1 software, in testHmd,<br>
 basically everywhere so I'm pretty sure it doesn't depend on the app or an app specific setting"

 <dd>Wonder if that line is intended or damaged xD<br>

 (<i>printed in bands; sometimes it happens.</i>)<br>
 Omg Guys that custom cable is something else üî•üî•üî•Literally the best cable I've seen<br> 
 While installing the driver I am looking at vr1,<br>
 a magnesium head strap would be more appropriate to such a super super high-end headset.<br>
 Okay picture is beyond phenomenal BUT, your brain needs to adjust<br>
 There is some kind of delay between head movement.<br>
 Like 40ms perhaps which makes you a little bit dizzy<br>
 ... that dizzy pressure feeling in the brain that something ain't right &nbsp
 (<i>lag from HDR setting</i>)<br>
 It's I guess aspherics I didn't use them for 3 years ...  But holy cow that fov üò±üòçüòçüòç<br>
 Manual [IPD] works but the change doesn't apply in the software (<i>Known bug</i>)<br>
 <img src=800705aa.jpg><br>
 I got a 3500&euro; monitor with 12 bit that's why it didn't work with VR1<br>
 Yeah need a much thinner facial interface mask<br>
 So far I found out that the headset has to be at 90hz at 60% resolution<br>
 so you have 3ms response time otherwise you will have the feeling that it's sluggish.<br>
 The LCD panels are slow in the vr1 as with varjo Aero.<br>
 It ain't HTC Vive pro 1 quickness. I think that's what we feel.<br>
 Hopefully 120hz next week that will reduce the latency.<br>
 (<i>tracking issues</i>) Had that too but restarted the PC and everything was fine.<br>
 First launch vr1 software then steam VR"
</details>

<!-- bears.are.cool -->
<dt><br><details><a name=bears><summary>"No power button just like Aero?</summary></a>
 Oof. Good thing I already have smart plugs in place<br>
 <dd>Do the panels autonpower off and if yes can the timeout time be adjusted?<br>
 Clicked through the wizard but it didn't trigger any tracking setup.<br>
 Didn't the first time either BTW. Just installed steamVR drivers<br>
 I had some major tracking issues (jumping all over the place for no reason)<br>
 OK got the tracking working, Varjo Base was still installed, that probably messed with it<br>
 In WIMFOV, it loads (via steam VR) and I see the mirror, and base stations are tracking fine.<br>
 Headset won't wake when put on; screens are off, LEDs are on..? &nbsp
 (<i>SteamVR VS OpenXR</i>)<br>
 Has anyone used OXRTK successfully yet? I disabled it earlier because it wasn't "in the right place".<br>
 It was at a weird distance and angle to me so I couldn't even read the text.<br>
 It seemed to be functional but not usable due to the weird positioning<br>
 Will try again now<br>
 ... Aaand MSFS crashed when trying to enter VR. Never had as many MSFS crashes as today<br>
 Not sure what causes this, but sometimes the resolution slide will display 0x0.<br>
 Moving the slider doesn't help.<br>
 <img src=resolution.jpg><br>
 Having said all this, the image sharpness and colors are absolutely STUNNING<br>
 when it's working somewhat. &nbsp
 Crazy contrast too. And lenses also much better than Crystal Light<br>
 And comfort feels pretty great too, although I haven't worn it long.<br>
 Feels a lot like the Aero in many respects (also visually),<br>
 which is NOT a bad thing from my perspective, was actually just what I wanted.<br>
 Really hope all the kinks can be ironed out!<br>
 Q3 and pro both have better e2e clarity, but that's expected. Or rather, their clarity extends further,<br>
 right to the very edge of the lense. In V1 there is some blurryness at the edges<br>
 I just cranked the resolution to 110% in MSFS and DAMN. now I see why we need 5090s. Nuts<br>
 NICE I got OXRTK working, simply needed to start it in safe mode<br>
 I dunno, details in the distance seem a lot more pixelated with this setting<br>
 than at equivalent resolutuons on PCL or Aero, maybe due to the larger FOV. BUt I'm still tweaking<br>
 Default FOV so far... just trying to establish basic operations..<br>
 I really want it to work but there is some weird issue<br>
 where OXRTK menu moves to an inaccessible place when not running it in safe mode.<br>
 Not sure if this is a VR1 problem but I've never had it before.<br>
 And it does offer some things that the VR1 tool doesn't over<br>
 like turbo mode and CAS sharpening and in-VR fps display<br>
 you can disable steamVR and the tracking still works<br>
 (still via steamVR, but in background only. SteamVR app is not open)<br>
 I'm beginning to think that<br>
 <i><b>MSFS crashes if VR1 tool is open and VR1 is connected while MSFS loads</b></i>.<br>
 But if I let it load first and then connect the HMD it seems fine+<br>
 At least i got OXRTK working properly by activating Legacy Menu mode, thanks to whoever said that!<br><br>

 ... seems my tracking issues was a problematic basestation<br>
 I just tried adding studioform counterweights and Pimax Crystal cushion<br>
 and this has improved comfort by a lot,<br>
 I'm lucky as I don't really plan on using steamVR much,<br>
 but it's completely unusable due to the 'delay' issue.<br>
 If i disable steamVR and use only openXR everything runs great<br>
 and BTW what is Brightness Correction?
 Even openXR via steamVR has the [lag] issue I think.<br>
 I can fix it by disabling steamVR in the VR1 tool and rebooting,<br>
 then running via Somnium OXR runtime only<br>
 3D effect is great<br>
 I had 2 instances when entering VR where the left panel simply didn't switch on<br>
 Leaving and entering VR again fixed it both times &nbsp (<i>this is a software glitch</i>)<br>
 How do you deal with the steamVR menu that appears within MSFS<br>
 when using that runtime? I couldn't handle it lol<br>
 just added the Apache strap on top of the counterweights and the Studioform Cushion<br>
 and now it's comfortable as hell, better than Aero actually üëç<br>
 But long test (1.5hrs+) still to be done<br>
 Basically, when looking at a super stable "object" like a menu<br>
 or a stationary plane in MSFS and moving head left to right,<br>
 a "wave/ripple" like distortion moves through the field of view very near the center.<br>
 There is even a point when what you are focusing on<br>
 seems to "shift/materialize" a small distance from the left to the right.<br>
 Once you see it you can't unsee it. <br>
 In addition, I can't seem to fully focus on most of the screen, and this is not due to my eyesight.<br>
 I don't have this issue in other headsets. <br>
 Any idea why the eye relief is disabled for me? Does it only work in steamVR mode?<br>
 <img src=relief.png><br>
 Anyone who already has one, try this: Look at a menu text and close your left eye,<br>
 then slowly move your head left to right and back and forth slowly. Is the text entirely stable?<br><br>

 When I look through my left eye only, it's basically stable. When I look through my right eye only,<br>
 I see very obvious warping/rippling and even see the text "telelport" a few milimetres.<br>
<hr>
I'd say it gets pleasantly warm, not at all more than expected. Also,<br>
 NO FOGGING whatsoever,none, zilch. PCL fogged like a MF.<br>
 Not even "noticeably" warm really. Warmer than when it's off, but that's expected<br>
 I just tested my FOV after all just to be able to compare, via WIMFOV.<br>
 I got 102H / 96V, but it felt a lot bigger (horizontally) in game, weird.<br>
 And this is with a slightly thinner than stock gasket.<br>
 Studioform cushion for Pimax Crytal, as recommended by VR flightsimguy. Really nice <br><br>

 For reference, in Q3 I got 110/100 and Aero 104/83.<br>
 It definitely felt bigger than both of these in game though,<br>
 surely the bug only affects the measurement tools?<br>
 I can't imagine the ACTUAL FOV getting bigger via the update. Hope I'm wrong though<br>
 VR optician claims they take distance prescription and adjust it for focal distance.<br>
 Didn't work out in my case it seems<br>
 You can already disable rendering for one eye via OXRTK<br>
 Warming is not an issue at all for me.<br>
 OXRTK is no longer supported but still functional with VRChat<br>
 <hr>
 Mapping buttons to keyboard is great. I was gonna hand in a feature request for this<br>
 IPD now working, nice<br>
 What do I need to do to enable the ET calibration? It's greyed out.  Eye tracking also greyed out<br>
 (<i><b>You need to start SteamVR or OpenXR compatible application first,<br>
 then the buttons will be available.</b></i>)<br>
 This is a bit counterintuitive<br>
 "Measure IPD": it shows me the spinning diamond, then this disappears.<br>
 But it doesn't tell me any values anywhere?<br>
 I got 114/96 (vs 102/96 before update)<br>
 ALthough I had the inserts in.. will try again without<br>
 Even with maxed out FOV rendering I only get 114/96 in WIMFOV, weird<br>
 Any tips on setting the inner angle FOV correctly?<br>
 Yeah the steamVR delay is 100% gone<br>
 still have the same wavyness as yesterday, more pronounced in right lense than left.<br>
 I don't think it's a deal breaker anymore as I'll probably get used to it in-game<br>
 but still not ideal. The effect can be lessened by moving the HMD further down<br>
 than I would've expected it to sit, sweetspot wise. <br>
 The virtual desktop function is AMAZING, it switches over so instantlya/seamlessly.<br>
 Just amazing. But how can I change the distance to and position of the screens??<br>
 I'm gonna have to get a 5090 cos 120% resolution in MSFS is blowing my socks off.<br>
 Brightness insane too Wavyness could be better üòâ<br>
 But yeah there's always compromises. And I think I'll get used to it<br>
 Varjo was a little wavy too<br>
 I don't want two cables, or the extra weight (not that the Visionary is heavy).<br>
 But yeah all in all, the more I get used to it, it's clearly the best PCVR (or other) HMD<br>
 I've ever tried. As it should be for the price!<br>
 But still a big THANK YOU for making it, I hope it's very successful.<br>
 A much needed thing in the current market, at least for those who want the best.<br>
 Comfort is also great, especially with counterweights<br>
 The colors/contrast are truly out of this world though. Comes close to my OLED TV<br>
 Are there any plans to make things like the IPD measurement and virtual desktop work<br>
 without manually starting a separate application?<br>
 I can only set the contrast slider to from 0 to 93% or to 100% or above.<br>
 If I set it to 94%-99%, it instantly snaps back to 100%!<br>
 I'm so impressed with how seamless and instant the transition from and to virtual desktop is! Insane.<br>
 And mapping keys to buttons is so useful. You can bind windows key<br>
 so that when you use VD it's easy to get your mouse pointer onto the second monitor<br>
 (because usually the VR monitor has it captured)<br>
 I only get black bars on periphery when FOV is set too small<br>
 All FoV tools other than WIMFOV need controllers, right? I don't have hand tracking<br>
 looking at the MSFS menu, which includes images of planes,<br>
 focusing one one such photo with one eye and then moving back and forth left and right,<br>
 a gentle ripple washes through the whole photo, everything morphs slightly<br>
 When both are enabled and the game supports openXR,<br>
 how does VR1 tool choose whether to use the VR1 openxr runtime or the steamVR openxr runtime?<br>
 How does one even remove the gasket? Haven't tried, do you just yank it out?<br>
 I already swapped put the cushion, didn't even notice the screws.<br>
 But yeah thinner gasket would be cool. I guess the current one is big enough to accommodate glasses?<br>
 <b>How does the system choose an OXR runtime when both steamVR and OpenXR are enabled?</b><br>
 Some games can only use openXR. And there are 2 openxr runtimes possible for VR1,<br>
 a Somnium one and a steamVR openxr runtime.<br>
 I'm wondering how the VR1 tool decides between the two possible openxr runtimes.<br>
 I would expect VR1 tool to also have a "current runtime" setting. But it doesn't have one right?<br>
 OXRTK works when set to Legacy Menu mode. Otherwise it's completely in the wrong place, tiny,<br>
 and rotates when you move your head lolol. At least when using VRG openXR runtime<br>
 if I disable the openXR setting and run MSFS, it runs via steamVR openxr.<br>
 So when both are on, how does it know which one to pick? Maybe it always prefers its own runtime?<br>
 MSFS uses whatever is the ACTIVE openxr runtime.<br>
 It should be clear in VR1 tool what is currently the active OXR runtime,<br>
 the same way steam has that setting, as does Oculus desktop app<br><br>
 
 I put on the thinnest cushion I have today (Kiwi 6mm for VIVE)<br>
 and my FOV increased from 114/96 to 124/102 lol!<br>
 BUT now I was also seeing black flashing on left and right periphery like you,<br>
 only in steamVR probably.<br>
 Guess it was there all along but my FOV wasn't wide enough to see it.<br>
 What's the easiest way to install SteamVR Beta?<br>
 When I was getting the low FOV values, I was using the Studioform cushion<br>
 which VRFSG recommended and which I thought was thinner than stock.<br>
 Looking at it more closely, it's actually a bit thicker, especially at the top.<br>
 But I think the Kiwi is still slightly thinner than stock<br>
 I've had HAGS off for years due to stutters in MSFS.<br>
 So now I have a strange issue (assuming in steamVR only) where if I look to the left,<br>
 I see some black flashing at the far right periphery and if I look to the right<br>
 I see some flashing on the far left periphery. This also happens when I close one eye.<br>
 Changing FOV rendering to max doesn't change it, actually made it worse I think <br>
 I have 7800x3D btw. Also, the flashing issue doesn't occur via VRG runtime,<br>
 only when using steamVR.<br>
 100% res at max FOV = 13759x7144, assuming an inner angle of 45 deg,<br>
 which makes sense for this estimation<br>
 it's the theoretical max. It's meaningless as no one can see it<br>
 100% res per eye at min FOV = 2426x2381, again with 45 deg inner angle<br>
 <b>Weird issue in interaction with MSFS</b><br>
 By process of elimination, I can now confidently say that MSFS (for me at least)<br>
 will always crash one way or another on the first attempt. After simply launching it again,<br>
 it loads fine with VR1 connected and I can renter VR without issues. It's then super stable.<br>
 But something is going on here,<br>
 what could be causing the crash on initial load but making the second load succeed?<br>
 Unfortunately now that my FOV has increased to 124 via thinner cushion,<br>
 I see more distortions in the periphery when moving head..<br>
 very similar to the Aero distortions upon launch probably.<br>
 But Varjo improved this via software, hope Somnnium can do the same.<br>
 Although it's very possible that my brain will remove these after using it some more.<br>
 Havent used the new cushion much yet <br>
 I get worse FOV with the stock cushion vs Studioform pimax.<br>
 And the latter is also amazingly comfortable.<br>
 But the kiwi is very comfortable too considering how thin it is<br>
 Compared to Aero, VR1 is pretty much better in every way,<br>
 except the software doesn't have a "sync fps to half refresh rate" function.<br>
 I don't think the Aero had the wavyness that I see in the middle of the right lens<br>
 Going from 90 to 125% in MSFS adds insane amount of extra detail in the distance<br>
 Ie building become actual buildings rather than a bunch of shimmering pixels<br>
 I tried VR1 with OpenComposite and Dirt Rally 2,<br>
 and there are major issues with recentering the VR view. It just puts you in random places.<br>
 The same game works fine when running native steamVR.<br>
 I think the stock strap is fine with counterweights, even better adding apache strap<br>
 Aspherics are definite a whole lot more swimmy than something like the Q3 pancakes.<br>
 Those are almost rock solid. My next HMD will definitely be pancake either way<br>
 IPD measurement works while you are running an OXR app, not steamVR<br>
 Can't say I've noticed (pupil swim change with temperature).<br>
 But the HMD doesn't get very warm at all anyway, I doubt they change temp that much<br>
 I couldn't get Dirt Rally 2 working properly via OpenComposite, only SteamVR.<br>
 I sometimes see the flashing black stuff,<br>
 but only when using steamVR runtime (and yes I have steam beta).<br>
 But it only seems to happen in steamVR home. But I haven't tried many steamVR games"<br>
 (<i><b>The flashing black lines is 100% software issue. Right from the monday morning<br>
 our team will be conducting tests and we will issue a hotfix if needed.</b></i>)

 Guess which cable is from VR1 and which index<br><img src=cables.jpg><br>
 Instead of a power brick I would have preferred one of those where all the weight is at the Socket<br>
 and the cable is all light all the way &nbsp But its good enough<br>
 <i><b>Feedback</b></i>: &nbsp at the ultraleap step it said 'drivers not installed',<br>
 &emsp; but didn't give me a button to install it, only a next.<br>
 &emsp; later in the software under the drivers tab could I click it<br>
 my extension cable might not be proper<br>
 for reference, the hd800s don't really fit. but these are gigantic headphones<br>
 <div align=center><img width=300 src=hd800.jpg></div>
 I think I have 1 [base station] that behaves worse then the other 3.<br>
 I'll disable it and see if it makes a difference<br>
 Skyrim just gave me a black screen but I did hear sound<br>
 Pavlov is still completely broken.<br>
 Alyx is playable but I need to dial in some settings, and perhaps turn of my ultrawide screen.<br>
 Bladed and sorcery seemed to work mostly fine<br>
 Until you fall as well.<br>
 I had all [Alyx] settings lowest, didn't see any resolution option though<br>
 I also don't know what the relation is between the resolution setting in steamvr vs in the vr1 app<br>
 With the SteamVR Beta I didn't have any black bars flickering, performance was solid.<br>
 <img width=480 src=Betas.png><br>
 When I looked left and right before it would be all be a bit weirdly moving. <br>
 And the eye relief fixed that.. Try -2 or +2<br>
 For the hand tracking:&nbsp In some games you want to turn it off.<br>
 In pavlov i couldn't grab stuff because it was in some sort of quantum state<br>
 of using both hand tracking and controlled and using neither for grabbing<br>
 You to go to steamvr, settings, turn advanced settings off,<br>
 and in the openxr tab disable hand tracking in thwt case.<br>
 Or perhaps in the VR1 tool is easier?<br>
 I now got good performance on 50% rendering on a 3080. But will depend on the application<br>
 Sounds like we need a google doc with pc specs and the settings that reach certain stable fps levels<br>
 Foveated rendering only works in openxr applications<br>
 How to know which game needs which runtime?<br>
 Wellz the VR1 tool needs some improvements to user friendliness<br>
 It should probably be a toggle between steamVR and OpenXR<br>
 some facescan to make the perfect fitting gasket + cushion would be amazing<br>
 after reinstall I never touched hags<br>
 I'll be adding the foveated rendering to pavlov to see if I can crank up the fps and then also the resolution<br>
 and it needs to use openxr <br>
 When using openXR explorer, you can add the VR1 runtime by editing the list and adding this entry:<br>
 <code>windows VrEngineers C:\ProgramData\vrg\oxr\vrg_openxr.json</code><br>
 Shodah wasn't using the VR1/vrengineers runtime, he was using the steamVr runtime.<br>
 thus he never had any problems with EAC, but also wasn't using foveated rendering<br>
 there were 3 screws I couldn't get loose, the screwdriver stripped and the screw a bit as well<br>
 <img src=stripped.jpg><br><br>
 I'm just saying, i'm at only 50% and it's already a night and day comparison<br>
 I haven't been able to run ANY game with the VRG runtime<br>
 the default face cushion is rather thiccc 2cm at it's thickest<br>
 honestly the whole openxr runtime and stuch still confuses me<br>
 let's put it like this, I have only been able to run the ROV tool through the VRG runtime.<br>
 anything else I had to run through the steamvr runtime.<br>
 I just played 2 hours of pavlov, and it was GLORIOUS.<br>
 buttery smooth, and even at 50% it's crisper then the index<br>
 Normally I'm on part with this one guy and I trounced him.  I defo have the hardware edge<br>
 there is a good chance my friend will also buy one, too bad for him that the queue is loong <br>
 my fov is a bit better with this thinner facecusion, no clue why you made such a thiccc boy<br><br>
 
 <b>My quick and dirty review</b><br>
 You want my opinion? well it's slightly biased<br>
 in the sense that I've never tried a pimax crystal or varjo aero.<br>
 best I've tried ever was a pimax 5K?  Mostly I've used a quest 2 and valve index. but ow boy.<br>
 There is no screen door effect, I think if I focus realllllly well I think I see a pixel,<br>
 but can also be aliasing, can't tell. everything is crisp and sharp at 50% rendering and buttery smooth<br>
 ( at least in pavlov) with a little room left to go to 60%.<br>
 It's great that you can render at lower resolution and apply sharpening.<br>
 My fov is larger then the valve indez and quest 2<br>
 it really depends on face shape and especially, the face cushion, the included face cushion is a thicc boy.<br>
 I also think the VR Optician lenses are too far from the actual lenses, robbing you off fov.<br>
 I would not have any issue with long periods of time using it.<br>
 after 2 hours there was no sweatiness inside, no hotness either<br>
 and this was with a room temp of 22 degrees celcius .<br><br>

 tracking is flawless.<br><br>

 my headset specifically has the anchor screws too tight<br>
 cause some issues with not being able to unscrew them, will give an update on this tomorrow.<br>
 There are 2 OpenXR runtimes, steamVR and VREngineer. the VREngineer runtime basically... doesn't work. <br>
 I've only had the ROV tool where it worked, everywhere else I tried it did not, and I've tried a few games.<br>
 The cable is nice and small and smooth, i've had no tangling whatsoever,<br>
 while I had it a bunch with the valve index.<br>
 The software is still finicky. sometimes it takes a few tries to get the headset running.<br>
 But It's literally the first public release and with some time and fixes<br>
 and improvements it will be a good experience.<br><br>

 Could very well be I adjusted to the lenses<br>
 I have not properly tested with VRO prescription lenses. I'll do that tomorrow to make sure<br>
 I saw some distortion at outer lens edge in the ROV test,<br>
 but it was literally on the last degrees of what I could see<br>
 I find FoV an irrational number<br>
 I don't think reinstalling Windows is needed. I just did it to prove that point.<br>
 I still had issues after reinstalling until switching steamVR versions<br>
 Sadly it sound easy. But the reality is that you'll need to play around with<br>
 settings from windows, nvidia steamvr and somnium to get a working config for you<br>
 I've had multiple times where it was like the software to change settings of the mouse and it's like.. why?"

<dt><br><details><summary>Ultimate Edition</summary>
"So, after I came home today, for me it was now the first time,<br>
<dd> installing and using the VR1 Ultimate Edition üôÇ<br>
  And oh, boy, it's a lot of USB cables üòÇ  And Artur,<br>
 you are crazy to make also the USB cable housing out of metal üò¨<br>
 <img src=lot.jpg><br>
 I had not much time to test a lot of the functionality in much detail.<br>
 At the beginning, the Ultraleap Module was not recognized.<br>
 After plugging the power off and on again,<br>
 I was able to also install the Ultraleap Module, which is working now üëç<br>
 Unfortunately, at the beginning I've also got some connection errors for the Mixed Reality Cameras,<br>
 but now they are also working. In my room it's a little bit dark,<br>
 but in Passthrough I was able to see everything and was able to read text on paper without issues.<br>
 Similar to Pico 4 passthrough, mixed realized cameras got very blurry<br>
 during head movement.&nbsp (<b><i>turn up the frame rate on the cameras</i></b>)<br>
 If you stand still, amazing sharp camera picture!<br>
 Regarding Visual in SteamVR, yes, the picture is super sharp,<br> if you stand still and not moving the head.<br>
 in my case, just start the VR1 tool will not turn on the displays for me.<br>
 Only after starting steamvr, the display is on..  I also assume, the virtual desktop is an openxr application,<br>
 right? Because it's starting in front of my steam vr menu environment<br>
 each time I'm opening that amazing storage box, the air smells like a new car<br>
 After more than 1 hour in VR with the VR1, it's a very interessting feeling with VR1.<br>
  The picture quality is crazy good, and the VR1 Software is also crazy, how much option you have.<br>
  But to be honest, a lot the software options I don't understand yet, or are not working yet for me<br>
 (at a lot of settings, just nothing changes for me).<br>
  Also the buttons seems to not work for me in the software.<br>
 At least by trying to open Mixed Reality mode or the button for the Virtual Desktop, nothing happens.<br>
 I've set one button for IPD measurement, and by clicking that button,<br>
 it's at least trying to start (you see the overlay), but is of course failing due to the eyetracking bug.<br>
 After about 30 minutes, the temperatur of the Headset is very warm.<br>
 You feel it, if you don't have it on your head all the time,<br>
 and after a few minutes you put it on, then it's very warm. So very good for the winter üòú <br>
 I'm using an older nVidia driver 565.90 and get tearing<br><br>
 
 For brightness, my slider goes from 0% to 100%, and it's snapping at 25%, 50%, 75% etc<br>
 And yes, by reducing the brightness and playing with contrast,<br>
 you can get also very good "local dimmed" picture with good blacks üòõ<br>
 For thoses who are interested in the Cables and it's recognized devices:<dl>
 <dt>Cable1:
 <dd>Power<br>DisplayPort<br> USB for:<ul>
 <li>Valve VR Radio - HID (Most probably controllers receiver)
 <li>Valve LHR - 3√ó HID (most probably LightHouse receiver)
 <li>Valve VR Radio - HID
 <li>Somnium VR1 - COM3, Audio
 <li>LEAP Motion Ultraleap Tracking Camera
 <li>Somnium EyeCam - Camera</ul>
 <dt>Cable2:
 <dd>USB Cable1 for Somnium MRCam - COM4<br>
 <dd>USB Cabel2 for Somnium MRCam - COM6</dl>
 Enabling Windows camera software shows the EyeTracking camera feed üôÇ<br>
 Buttons on VR1 are also now working for me after the Update üëç<br>
 after enabling eye tracking.. at least, heatmap shows something for me<br>
 What exactly is "Calibrate Head pose" for?<br>
 With first version of VR1 tool it not had any effect to me.<br>
 Just measured IPD with 60% Render resolution, and getting 84¬∞ VFOV and about 98¬∞-104¬∞HFOV..<br>
 But I am with 60mm IPD.. I have also a very unfavorable face üòÖ<br>
 I've switched in the VR1 tool at Headset > Advanced to a custom profile,<br>
 and moved all the sliders to it's minimum.<br>
 Then I've closed one eye, started increasing the slider for "Horizontal Inner Angle",<br>
 until I don't see any increase of picture anymore in the inner view.<br>
 Then I did the same for Horizontal Peripheral Angle,<br>
 until I stopped seeing any more of the picture view on the outer sides of the lenses.<br>
 for me it's Innger Angle = 30¬∞ and Peripheral Angle = 48¬∞<br>
 With this settings, I've measure my FOV with HMDTestTool until the max I can see,<br>
 and it matches the Steam VR view at it's max, which is then 96¬∞ HFOV for me<br>
 <img width=640 src=VR1-max-FOV-neudy.jpg><br><br>

 I just wanted to provide first feedback, after reinstalling my Windows 11,<br>
 the flickering black bars are gone during regular use of the Headset üëç <br>
 Also the FOV got a little bit better for me with 90¬∞ VFOV and 104¬∞ with TestHMD tool<br>
 and with WimFOV it's 88¬∞ VFOV and 109¬∞.<br>
 I've tried to max it out, by removing the FaceGasket Foam and look into the lenses with my eyes glued on,<br>
 and yes, I can see much more from feeling üòú <br>
 The Foam I've finally replace with a VRCover 6mm foam, which I had laying around for my Quest2<br>
 and this is very comfy and the visuals are much better. But unfortunately,<br>
 now the Lens Housings are standing on my nose, which is not so comfortable, but OK<br>
 <b><i>To be fair, I had already a lot of test Software running</b></i>,<br>
 then all other software stuff for Vive, Aero, Pico, Meta Headsets etc.<br>
 and I was running onto the latest nvidia driver bug with incompatibility with corsair iCue software along.<br>
 Therefore, instead of investigating into which software could be the culprit,<br>
 I've reinstalled windows and installed only minimal software to have a clean start,<br>
 and nothing which might interfere otherwise.<br>
 This can happen to all kind of software and is nothing to blame VR1 software..<br>
 So nothing to worry about"</details>
