<h2>Steam VR "outside-in" tracking base stations</h2>
One of either suffices for seated VR.
<dl><dt><b>Version 1.0 vs 2.0</b>
<dd>2.0:&nbsp up to 4 lighthouses can be used,<br> optical sync by swept laser
instead of separate area flash.<br>
<dt><a href=./>Version 1.0</a>:&nbsp 120 degree FoV with up to 2 flat-faced lighthouses;&nbsp
	<a href=Vive.pdf><i>manual</i></a>
<dd>4.5m max separation in two revisions:
<ul><li>first with an irregular layout of 15 LEDs
   <li>second with a square 3x3 grid of 9 LEDs</ul>

<br>V 1.0 controllers work only with V1.0 lighthouses.
<br>V2.0 controllers are backward compatible with V1.0 lighthouses.

At best, SteamVR reports:<br><img src=NotTracking.jpg>
<br>My impression is that something, somehow is supposed to
<br> synchronize a sweeping IR beam from it to VR1, and something
<br>(VR1?) communicates detected sweeps to SteamVR software.

<br><br>On my Windows 11 PC, Bluetooth did not detect the base station
<br>until after <a href=https://github.com/kurotu/OVR-Lighthouse-Manager>OVR Lighthouse Manager</a> installation,
<br>which also did not detect the base station until after typing in its ID.
<br>Windows <i>still</i> did not detect it
<br>before several base station <code>Power On</code> and <code>Sleep</code> cycles. 
<br>Windows Bluetooth Settings report base station <code>Not connected</code>
<br>except briefly while OVR Lighthouse Manager cycles it.

<br><br><b>How does SteamVR determine whether base station is tracking devices?</b>
<br>Without tracking, VR1 displays only <b>Virtual Desktop</b> and <b>Mixed Reality</b>.

<br><br>How to wake up VR1 for SteamVR???
<br>What is <code>Mode A</code>?&nbsp;  (seemingly channel A)

<br><br>Smartphone cameras reportedly show base station IR beams.
<br>This is what my iPhone SE 2020 camera shows:<br><img src=smartphone.jpg>

<br><br>Base station instructions have <i>nothing</i> about "mode a",
<br>only Channel button and Channel indicator, which displays <b>A</b>.
<br>The SteamVR message has NOTHING about setting mode A,
<br>simply displaying in the corner:&nbsp; <img align=middle src=ModeA.jpg>

<br><br>Setting base station channel to <b>b</b> yields these SteamVR message boxes:
<br><img src=ModeB.jpg>
<br>Something gets communicated between the base station and SteamVR..
<br><img src=T.jpg>
<br>As I have come to expect with SteamVR,
<br><code>More info</code> means only <i>more drivel</i>, irrelevant to base stations...
<br><img src=wake.jpg>
<br>VR1 still displays Somnium Tool Virtual Desktop and Mixed Reality
<br>otherwise only light gray...

<br><br>How to get <b>somnium</b> listed in SteamVR <b>Manage SteamVR Add-Ons</b>?
<br>I went thru the ordeal of uninstalling and reinstalling Somnium VR1 Tool
<br>which required rebooting and was interrupted by Windows installing 24H2...
<br>but <b>Add-Ons</b> still does not show <b>somnium</b>:
<br><img src=Add-Ons.jpg>

<br><br>Where is VR1 Tool tracking test option?
<br>- I have no idea how to check or update base station firmware
<br>&emsp; blindly connecting its USB port to a PC seems doomed;
<br>&emsp; powering base station on with channel button pressed
<br>&emsp; reportedly puts it in firmware update mode,
<br>&emsp; but no indication <b>how to recover if/when that fails</b>,
<br>&emsp; as often as VR1 and SteamVR for me <i>already have, multiple times</i>.
<br>&emsp; <img src=bluetooth.jpg>
<br><br>&emsp; <img src=update.jpg>
<br>- Having previously used only WMR headsets,
<br>&emsp; I have never seen <i>any base station work</i>.
<br>- I can feel this base station housing slightly vibrate when on,
<br>&emsp; then stop when OVR Lighthouse Manager Sleeps it...

<dt>Version 2.0:&nbsp two curved face revisions with 150 degree FoV, 5.5m max separation
<dd><ul><li> built by Valve for Vive Pro, slightly more compact.<br>
 HTC provided power adapter,
  port for syncing to V1.0, but never developed.
<li>second built by Valve for Index;&nbsp slight appearance but no functional difference.</ul>
