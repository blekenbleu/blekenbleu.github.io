<h2>Steam VR "outside-in" tracking base stations</h2>
One of either suffices for seated VR.

At best, SteamVR reports:<br><img src=NotTracking.jpg>
<br>My impression is that something, somehow is supposed to
<br> synchronize a sweeping IR beam from it to VR1, and something
<br>(VR1?) communicates detected sweeps to SteamVR software.

<br><br>On my Windows 11 PC, Bluetooth did not detect the base station
<br>until after <a href=https://github.com/kurotu/OVR-Lighthouse-Manager>OVR Lighthouse Manager</a> installation,
<br>which also did not detect the base station until after typing in its ID.
<br>Windows <i>still</i> did not detect it
<br>before several base station <code>Power On</code> and <code>Sleep</code> cycles. 
<br>Windows Bluetooth Settings report base station <code>Not connected</code>
<br>except briefly while OVR Lighthouse Manager cycles it.

<br><br><b>How does SteamVR determine base station device tracking?</b>
<br>Without tracking, VR1 displays only <b>Virtual Desktop</b> and <b>Mixed Reality</b>.

<br><br>How to wake up VR1 for SteamVR???
<br>What is <code>Mode A</code>?&nbsp;  (seemingly channel A)

<br><br>Smartphone cameras reportedly show base station IR beams.
<br>This is what my iPhone SE 2020 camera shows:<br><img src=smartphone.jpg>

<br><br>Base station instructions have <i>nothing</i> about "mode a",
<br>only Channel button and Channel indicator, which displays <b>A</b>.
<br>The SteamVR message has NOTHING about setting mode A,
<br>simply displaying in the corner:&nbsp; <img align=middle src=ModeA.jpg>

<br><br>Base station channel set to <b>b</b> yielded these SteamVR messages:
<br><img src=ModeB.jpg>
<br>Base station and SteamVR communicate <i>somehow</i>...
<br><img src=T.jpg>
<br>As I have come to expect with SteamVR,
<br><code>More info</code> means only <i>more drivel</i>, irrelevant to base stations...
<br><img src=wake.jpg>
<br>VR1 still displays Somnium Tool Virtual Desktop and Mixed Reality
<br>otherwise only light gray...

<br><br>In SteamVR <b>Manage SteamVR Add-Ons</b>,
<br> &emsp; <b>somnium</b> is currently specific to Beta OpenXR
<br>Unaware, I uninstalled and reinstalled Somnium VR1 Tool
<br>which required rebooting, interrupted by Windows 24H2 update...
<br><img src=Add-Ons.jpg>

<br><br>Where is VR1 Tool tracking test option?
<br>- I have no idea how to check or update base station firmware
<br>&emsp; blindly connecting its USB port to a PC seems doomed;
<br>&emsp; powering base station on with channel button pressed
<br>&emsp; reportedly puts it in firmware update mode,
<br>&emsp; but no indication <b>how to recover if/when that fails</b>,
<br>&emsp; as often as VR1 and SteamVR for me <i>already have, multiple times</i>.
<br>&emsp; <img src=bluetooth.jpg>
<br><br>&emsp; <img src=update.jpg>
<br>- Having previously used only WMR headsets,
<br>&emsp; I have never seen <i>any base station work</i>.
<br>- Base station housing slightly vibrates when on,
<br>&emsp; then stop when OVR Lighthouse Manager <code>Sleeps</code> it...

<dt><br><b>Version 2.0</b>:&nbsp two curved face revisions
<dd> with 150 degree FoV, 5.5m max separation
<dd><ul><li>first built for Vive Pro, slightly more compact.<br>
 HTC provided power adapter;<br>
  port for syncing to V1.0 waas never developed.
<li>second built by Valve for Index;
<br>slight appearance but no functional difference.</ul>
&emsp; <img src=shipping.jpg>

<dt><br><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.11523>Lighthouse Positioning System</a> (for UAV research)
<dd>Version 2.0 (Fig. 1b) has one rotating drum with two planes
<br>each at a different angle (Fig. 1e and f).
<br>Drum rotates at a slightly different rate,
<br>depending on channel number.
<br>Thus, light planes of
different base stations may periodically collide

<dt><br><a href=https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/index/base-stations>Base Station 2.0 - Valve</a>
<dd>A single coded laser sweep and no omnidirectional blinker,
<br>base stations co-exist with your other IR devices
<br> and have better immunity from depth cameras
<br> and motion capture systems.
