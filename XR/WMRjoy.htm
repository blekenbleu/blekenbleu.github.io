<h2>Joystick as controller in WMR (2021)</h2>

<dt><strong><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/275850/discussions/0/1636418037465132951/">Hand-On Throttle-And-Stick (HOTAS) as VR controller</a></strong>
<dd><i><b>This worked in 2021</b>;&nbsp; Steam now handles game controllers separately from<br>
so-called non-Game controllers, which are not recognized by SteamVR.</i>

<ul><br><a name=HOTAS>Until <a href=https://gitlab.com/znixian/OpenOVR>OpenComposite</a>,
<br><img width=800 src=img/OpenComposite.jpg>
<br>Assetto Corsa in Odyssey+ involved both Windows Mixed Reality Portal and SteamVR</a>,<br>
which support VR controllers that I find intolerable
and make no sense in driving sims.<br>
In VR without a controller, 2-D apps (e.g. Content Manager) become problematic,<br>
except perhaps in a virtual desktop.<br>
For than a couple of controller buttons, a flight joystick (HOTAS) may be wanted.<br>
<br>
        <li>In Steam &gt; Settings (SteamVR must be turned off)<br> &gt; Controller, General controller settings.<br>
        Uncheck all but Xbox Configuration Support<br>
		 and Xbox Extended Feature Support.
        <li>Go to detected controllers, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1839832921">customize
		 HOTAS layout</a>.&nbsp Save.
        <li>Open SteamVR;  a gamepad icon should appear.<br> If not, be sure to open SteamVR by clicking VR button in Steam.</li>
        <li>Make applicable mappings from virtual gamepad in SteamVR app.<dl>
        <dt>TIPS:<br />
     <dd>- If HOTAS Throttle doesnâ€™t work or is mapped upside down,<br />
     &nbsp; clear the input and map it to <b>W</b> and <b>S</b> keys with a joystick profiler.<br />
    - Make sure no keys are pressed while launching the game.</dl>

<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/992490/discussions/4/2646360608728224193/">
    Big Picture and SteamVR are 2 competing interfaces to Steam content,<br>
    and only one can "own" the controller.</a><br>
<br>
At least "xbox" and "start" buttons are needed on Xbox controller..<br>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/4lfksg/cant_access_the_steamvr_menu_with_xbox_360/">
Press Win key + G, go to settings, and disable "use xbox button to open game bar"</a><br>

<br>
Windows Mixed Reality added Win32 app native support
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WindowsMR/comments/ezlq19/when_i_launch_the_mixed_reality_portal_windows/<br>">
with Windows 10 Version 1903</a>.<br>
I do not know how they get launched:<br>
"Access the feature by bringing up Pins Panel via the windows button on your controller,<br>
 then go to all apps, where you will find a folder named 'Classic Apps'.<br>
 In this folder, you will be able to select and launch any Desktop (Win32) applications."<br>
