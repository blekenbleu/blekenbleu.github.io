"We are planning both 72 and 120 Hz release at the same time in August."<br><br>

"Nvidia has VR1 and working on drivers"<br><br>

"We made several test runs production batches.<br>&nbsp Now we do customer headsets."<br><br>

"...we run test runs, we stop, evaluate and correct,<br>
&nbsp then run again and decide whether those go to customer batches or not.<br>
&nbsp Evaluate again.&nbsp We repeat and repeat.&nbsp Production is not a static thing.<br>
&nbsp We inform users about most important milestones<br> &nbsp
 but not about every single small deviation from a plan.<br>
&nbsp In between June and now there has been many steps"<br><br>

Optical stack assembly is slower than expected, with lower yield.<br>
Final assembly next week, personally inspected and approved by Artur.<br>
1-2 week certification delay;<br>&nbsp U.S. possible unit shipments first second week of September.<br>
Plans are in place to have 2 shifts of production.<br>
Local dimming estimate  is for October or November.<br>
Next update probably in the beginning of September.<br><br>

Final tests with VR Opticians are happening.&nbsp Ordering should open<br>
about the same timeline as first or second customer unit batch.<br><br>

Anchor point 3D files will be released this month along side first shipments.<br>
They will try to release them earlier.<br>
