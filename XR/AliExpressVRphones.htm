<dd>I mean, you have to slide them on, but yeah they're fine.
<br>I got them for my wife for her Quest 2 back in the day, they sounded great.
<br>So they <i>should</i> fit stock strap fine

<dt><br>I got the earphones and they are pretty cool.

<br>Better sound than DAS, much more bass and more balanced overall.

<dd><br>Whats kind of dumb is fitting them on requires a tiny Alan key
<br> and the included one is the wrong size lol.
<br>Was able to use a tiny flathead screwdriver though.

<br><br>They don't sit on the ears as well as they could
<br> because the VR1 headband is so much wider than other HMDs,
<br> but they sit well enough for good sound

<dd>And yeah thanks for the recommendation, definitely an upgrade from the DAS.
<br>Might work even better if they were moved right to the back
<br>as the headband has a smaller circumference there,
<br>but could get sketchy when loosening/tightening.
<dd><br>They cannot worn away from ears, like G2 or Index phones,
<br>lacking a "click" mechanism to switch positions.
