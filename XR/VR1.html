Artur claims [34:14/1:20:13] that main customers will be more consumers than enterprises, but IMO cost and value will better fit businesses.
<li>Independent of application, VR1 runtime supports masking and mesh upload of CAD for e.g instrument panels.
<h4><a href="https://vr-compare.com/compare?h1=INGl_L_43&h2=fJwyyQiC3">VRcompare:&nbsp Crystal vs VR1</a></h4>
<h4><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SomniumSpaceVR/videos">SomniumSpaceVR videos</a></h4>
<pre>
Focus distance < 85cm
Probably prescription lenses from VR Lens Lab, VROpticians
4436 x 4157 is native rendered resolution for 2880x2880 per eye; 35ppd
(same panels as Crystal)
"super clear undistorted 125°+ FoV"
Pimax Crystal QLED vs Somnium VR1; 90 & 120Hz
Mixed reality cameras 2x 4000x3000 with 125°+ FoV
700-850 grams
576 local dimming zones per eye;  perhaps not needed, because low glare optics.
<a href="https://nofio.co/">Nofio wireless</a> later.
</pre>
<ul>
<li>optic block with two aspheric lenses (Artur holds them in the hand)
<li>the optic block is 4 times sharper than the panel resolution would require
<li>90 degrees stereo overlap
<li>120+ degrees horizontal FoV
<li>local dimming with 576 zones per eye, 200+ nits brightness,<br>
 and while no panel resolution was shared it's obvious it's the same panel as on the Crystal
<li>manufacturing tolerance is 10 microns from the lens ideal shape
<li>face interface that can be fixed with magnets on the HMD (identical mechanism as on the G2),<br>
 and people can 3D print their own as CAD files will be provided

<li>there will be one 6m optic cable + something (DisplayPort/VirtualLink/DisplayLink?) for the variant without MR cameras,<br>
 and one additional identical cable (connected on the other side of the headset) to carry on the MR camera feed back to the PC

<li>they have their own OpenXR runtime implementation
<li>eye tracking is also their own implementation, in their framework, but will opensource everything about it, including the algorithm
<li>motion compensation is in the framework they developed, and they will expose it for the sim community
<li>they also mentioned about how the Mixed Reality cockpit mapping will work:<br>
 you take the CAD of your car/airplane cockpit and feed it to their software,<br>
 and then you can just interact with it with your hands (you'll need both hand tracking module and MR cameras on the HMD)

<li>very large MR camera resolution, something like 4000 x 3000 I think
<li>MR camera refresh rate is 90 fps
<li>MR angle of view through cameras is 120, just like through the HMD,<br>
 so you will not see the FoV shrink when you enable the MR camera passthrough
<li>SteamVR needed for tracking
<li>As of 27 Sep 2023, development appears complete;&nbsp most remaining issues are financial
<li>Sept update and sign-ups likely to slip into first week of Oct.
<li>VR2, several years away, will use <a href="https://www.hypervision.ai/">pancake lenses</a>.
<li>3D video capture from passthru cameras will be a thing;  target for software was unclear (to me).
<li>Passthru video processing in the PC, wanting more CPU threads than standalone HMD of comparable resolution and frame rate
