I won't seem to everyone it's fine maybe your one
do I sound ok by the way second it's working okay so
fancy green screen yeah that's not bad green but I look
today we started with magic I can do this and that's
that's the way you want to show you can't show everybody
that's it again spoiler on your back we are one we are one
in the front so it works we are still small over all right
we're 82 people so short it's time to play the song before we start
come on let's do it play the song let's do it we'll play the song
before we start give yeah it's your intern connection
it's got my problem my upload can't keep up really my pixelated
a little bit thick it's okay it hides all your imperfections
oK I'm big sweater let me try have all the things I might I might
I might hugging a lot of pics of all Right right right
so I'll maybe you are weird any people perfect number
I think we can slowly stop yeah it's i'm unfortunately because
it's also 9:00 o'clock in the evening
i'm not in the office nor I'm at home I i'm at the relative school
so surely we can turn on the music and we can everybody go
the message everybody got the memo it's the final
but yeah so it's a final countdown
and today it's truly the final countdown
so yeah so mind check connection
might be a little bit unstable if it is let me know
I might just you know it's important that you hear me well
viewing me well it's secondary oh look just move slower okay
I wanted to say that welcome everybody OK we'll spend 5 hours
it was a Minecraft doing good and it's okay
I might not fix it am I that fixed latest no no we can hate
is it estimated that's the main thing that
they're all just trolling you
OK anyways World Cup remember buddy thank you for coming
I'm very excited or for today's update and generally for the whole progress
and gosh put a journey and sort of what what what what a journey was and
and still is and probably will be with all of you
but yeah today we gather to go through many topics
with one surprise in the end but we'll definitely go through
and have some notes here we'll definitely go through
development updates production update orders update deliveries
some new connect and then probably take some questions from from you guys
and girls and Yeah and then we'll do the the peculiar
and I'll definitely need your I'll definitely need your assistant
so we'll do some entertainment but interactive session I think
so that's that will have some I'll create some polls during this session
and definitely will need you to devote just to see
what is you know what are your thoughts and stuff like that
so let's start 1 by 1 so the development update
obviously as you know as we've as we've talked before
the last 5% are always you know nailing
the last 5% are always this lowest one
and that's what we have been doing for for several months right now
on one hand we've been you know finishing some things we wanted to finish
and also improving some things we we wanted to to to make better
we did since the last visit of Youtubers
we did I think three or four iterations of lenses
and when I say iterations of lenses
these are microchanges to to basically perfect surfaces even more
even since the thief verified same guy got his headset
with two two iterations of lenses so you aren't having the best one Steve
I have the best one now okay I'm sorry but yes so that's that's that's that
and these are you know these are these are just small changes
it doesn't affect any timeline we're doing that because we have time
and we yeah so it's it's I'm just reading the the chat here the the the the
so we're improving that we have been working you know with slide changes
on this trap we have been working on for you know for their girl makes
we've been working and doing some big changes on the pacemask shape
so again what Steve has is almost final shape but not the final face cushion
so that has changed became more comfortable
so all those things these these are you know
these are the things where we've been working on everything is fine
we you know we don't have any huge delays or anything
we have also been improving some parts of the of some of their choice
of small ones which which don't affect anything
but they need to improve some some things for betters
you know connectivity and things like that so you know
hiring out every bit's impossible thing to make the headset
as same as possible yet even though for example
Steve has been testing and thanks Steve here thank you if you don't
if you're not anyway thank you very much for testing VVR 1 hour
for giving us a lot of feedback for for loving VR1 that's world
my heart the most you know seeing you using it every day and and and and loving it
that's just that's just of course current you know what if so
I mean every time I see someone loving me I want
it's just for me working for years on this on this device
and for the whole team they're watching these videos too you know
they you know it makes us work even harder and just want to deliver
so on the development side for the hardware where we're on track
all the things are are are basically better the headset in its current state is amazing
and we've been also going through the software development
and the software development is ongoing and it will be going on still until the first releases
and the 1st delivers on the headsets and we'll be showcasing the software on some new connect
and you will hear the dates of this underconnect today
I will tell you what is where is the end and and yeah so
so the software software development is going again
in terms of the stability of the software and capabilities of the software see
this testing the same alpha 1.5 version of this software he you know
he didn't encounter any errors was able to modify check and you know
change the the settings and some Islamic and I'm loving it
I've not had a problem with our software for three plus months
I'm using via 1 every day and no crashes nothing
so that's that's important right because that's so
but this divide is important but also the capability is the software is important
to you know I flash sharpening where it can be done you know apply
apply change the fobs and the carbon and everything so that's
that's important one is still being worked on is of course
optimizations so they you know our weather pipelines and stuff that
they're being optimized by the team to gain the maximum performance
and also to gain the best possible visual results thanks for that are being optimized
So I would say we're going from stable alpha 1.5 to stable data
and I think it's table data that's what we'll call it when we release the VR1
I think by by the by the standards of maybe other whatever makes whatever
we could be able to call it even a final release
but but we will just call it just to give us a little bit of room for or the for the for the updates
so that's that's the development part I again happy to say everything is positive we
don't have any any huge deal break and sell this to the left
everything is prepared the you know will go slowly into the production update
and production update as I told last time
we are working with the factory very actively you know
factory has gathered all the materials and everything to to start producing
their ones with factories doing now is also going through the processes
of actually assembling and training and having the manners and everything
to make sure that we you know they can fully assemble the devices
that they can you know perform all the quality control checks on you know
inbound checks and and during the process and outbound checks you know
the shipments and everything has a lot of subsystems which begin
which are invisible to you guys as customers as it should be
but not invisible for us And
because we're not a huge corporation which does ship millions of pieces of whatever
we are also learning some of the things along the way and dealing with the partners
but you know it's it's exciting to kind of to get to know
that part of the business and everything is everything is going well it's going on time
and we don't have any big hiccups you know here and there is some small things are always always present
but we don't have any big hiccups on the so in terms of yeah we're good
we'll get to the deliveries and in terms of the production the the factory looks good
and the production processes looking good and everything in general is is is very positive again if
if I would be talking if I would be telling to you like what kind of small things would go we're going through
it will go through and we're going through I will probably spend here 24 hours
and I can write a book about this but maybe when I get older I run about Google with
the creation of year one book of changes what the hell have I thought
would have been thinking when I decided to make a VR headset was I crazy
why like things like this 24 hours stream right maybe maybe listen to the comment first
and then I will appear yeah but I mean look III listen you know you know
I would say I would say it's an insult if you buy VR1
you would not be able to close your eyes
because the image is so beautiful like take some **** headset
and then sleep it okay but in ver 1 you better look straight
because that's where you write some more that's what you like
it's too bright it's too bright yeah what is going on there oh my gosh
you're driving raising like a yeah off topic derailing off topics
so what else do we have here order some date OK or something
so we are planning to open orders within the next two to three weeks
now I don't give you the day-to-day exact date because it depends on other factors
but that's where where the orders will open that's our internal deadline
which also depends on many other things or which affects many other things
but within the maximum of three weeks from now we want to open orders
and to add to people stop playing people who reserve their sports
I actually actually buying the buying the headsets
so that's the end that's the data point for your number one
that's where very close where we're there exact date will be announced
don't forget don't forget you will not miss it
we'll of course inform everybody via email
but we are also going to We're also going to of course announce in the discord and everywhere
so that's hand point and data point number one
number two deliveries update and that is that is planned
depending on how things go we will start delivering things in the to this later so June
being different units now wanted to do it in May and we won't connect in May
but obviously we decided shifted a little bit and very so the orders was in May
deliveries it won't be hitting you like in slightly depending on your number of preservation
people depending on what you slightly lagging like can you hear me can you hear me can you hear me now hey now yeah yeah OK
so as I said the quarters will start how is what is basically happening
So you won't be waiting for month and months I mean depending on your reservation number
and how many orders will come But if you're in the beginning you will be getting it in in in probably yeah
first half of June or definitely June so we're here so that's deliveries
and of course for example for those who are early in the in the orders
And we are trying to get that we'll see if we are be successful but that's the target
so 2nd week of June is where we're targeting some new connect
now here comes here comes at first Interactive part we'll do a quick pull
ah I was sick and OK I'll invoke you so I will do I will do a quick call
and this this poll please answer right now in the chat our answer is well in red
all right all right of course some new connect will be in Prague
in person will be incredible event will let people test their ones
play with racing with flight sim cockpits and all the latest
like Tesla's huge testing and all this kind of stuff
so many chats that's getting so via odds some of us will get yes yes I see it I see it okay
there's the 0 to get it 400 and I didn't connect if they ordered on the first one
and it comes on and connect that's probably that might happen
that's what I always want to have so no sound did I froze did
I froze a little bit but I think I think I think they understood what you said
to the zero chance but again it before something of connect
okay so we have 69% of it's very nice number 69% saying or 70% saying no they can't
we have 12% say yes and some say I don't know yet okay that's good yeah
my audio is breaking up again i'm not at home i'm at the right home
because I have to help the family with some stuff
but you know I want to do this update so on the Internet is a little bit of
I can actually try let me try something let me try something yeah I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure okay
let's let me let me try it please hit me now yep so next so that's the Sony connect again
let's repeat the data points I just I just told you we have
orders we're going to open within the next three weeks so orders in May
1st delivered in June someone connected second week of June
this is our current internal call and our current best estimation
which I think is very close to what it will be
now there are some questions obviously I don't want to go into details
but from from the point of view of testing of year number 1
there are definitely you know the people guarantee the sharpness the brightness
the field of view are just unbelievable and again I know it sounds cheesy
but I will say anyway because I don't see a handset with this kind of specs yet
so I'm very very happy about how it turned out
we've done quite a significant update on on warping
and we will be doing several more warping updates releases
until even something connect the icon improved things dramatically
and we're expecting much more interesting things coming out of those updates
so the image right now it's just very very good like it's just very good
so we're talking with this question when will Youtubers get a chance for food
first of all Steve here for some night he's a Youtuber okay he has no idea with us
he has a headset and his disposal is he has you know he's using it every day
so that's one of the you know end points for for for you that's number 1
we discussion with under each other's to be able to to to be able to thank sort of
to be able to go and and to come and and test it
and depending on the availability and timeline
it will probably end up either they will come before some connected test
or they will come at 2 someday connect directly and test
so I think these are you know these are the timelines right now
when they'll be coming too early before you know it's also
it's something such a treat and such a great event
it doesn't make sense to fly them in two weeks before something connected
and then they will fly back and then it will fly again back to the rock
it just doesn't make sense so they would of course of course of course right
this forces stays on that he's always welcome and he so even he yeah brad
brad for example exactly cents for you know going to be at some new connect as well
and Steve is saying I have a fun immune at the moment i'm going to get a feedback into the team yeah
so you know Steve is great in terms of like for example Steve has a lot of feedback
and the first week when he thought that we also changed some things
and so 1st side he got us you know he gave us some I would say most of you like
I don't think he's not also the state but yeah I think if you watch Steve's videos
in terms of what he you know he I think five or six things he loved and two things he didn't like
so when his content great videos but yeah I was dare to say that Steve likes 010
my God controversy coming So yeah that's definitely it's just a little bit
Steve listen if you don't like it to switch you in the back to me OK
sided back to me remember sweet love I'll draw down I want to put on my face
you see there is some yeah so yeah so basically basically we are
he's pretending he didn't hear like culture you're all your sound is not as breaking out
it's breaking what did he say you want to send the 2nd one or what but at the end
so racing video steeped and do it we have a single yeah exactly
we are a single guy single he have to open a second channel you know like
it's very it's very good anyway i'm very lingua but like it's
you have to have your play team guy and then we are we are a team guy
you have two channels we'll be raising one will be stuff about yeah
so let me again recap for those who joined where 89 people thank you for coming by the way
so number one development is going really well with
with basically polished all the things we wanted to punish production update
factories is is getting ready is you know also training and and and preparation for for them
as production is there orders first orders observations in May 1st deliveries in June
these are the important ones something connect we are aiming at this second week of June
now I remembered in another important part so let me go back to
Yeah well then I'm gonna go back to the pool and call you
anything you decided you know we'll show you something we are no no no no no no no in June
did you give me do you hear me go to give me hello yeah we hear him hello
for it right wait wait wait wait wait hear me now we did is he gone he's falling into the pit of lack of bandwidth
in a second you'll it'll be he'll be here he'll be here hope is your brighter yes yes
it is it's brighter than my future
I mean I've never seen it yet but I've been what I've heard from quite
like even like we look at the certain you kinda after like all that's bright
because I said earlier about the sun there is hello hello hello hello
you don't need to see me i'm feeling you need to hear me you're hearing
all that send anyone to confirm that you can hear me the phones up for hearing
yes we can hear you just be sure I think any concert off your video as well cause you're
you're feeling my benefits sort of turn on your video now I need turn 4K off
you there you go OK so now you're hearing well right yeah let's make
i'm sorry guys OK put me oK some guy was still on my Google yeah
this guy's some guy gonna hate the newspaper OK cool
so what I'm saying is there are two new data points i'm gonna introduce you to this each of this discussion right now
very important ones once we will also be present and after some connection will be president
two more international events the important one for youth here is this one
and we are even partners with them and we'll have a booth
and a sim culprit from VRG and VR ones there and that is my dear friends
is this light seem expocable if anyone from you is gonna be near Las Vegas
on the 21st or 22nd or 23rd of June oh my goodness
you will be able to experience VR1 in person on our stand
you know what happens in Vegas so what happened is all that
he's taken off about this that's that's that's that's
this in Germany yeah from Germany need to come to Prague why you why
why you come to blow defense to Las Vegas you have to go to practice coming in connect
okay i'm coming there you go in Las Vegas OK so um okay so that's Vegas and right before flight C Maxwell
so we are also I think we're planning phones or whatever confines it makes
what's the way on the sting will be will be present
there will probably have a keynote speech and that and we'll have the other ones there
and we'll understand with this way better
and see if something will be able to say we have one
so I will not go to Vegas because I will be busy making sure that all your headsets
are being produced and delivered to you all you
that will have four head Vegas and few other folks and we before Vegas
before front slide some export there will be also in Santa Clara I think there's AW event
and on AWE event we're still kind of polishing out the detail
but it's enemy will be on the alternative stand also showcasing for a few days 3 year one
so if someone will get awe you can of course experience there
but the flight seem exposed is the one to be and is the 10 the experience
here was some definitely commits that opportunity where an agent whatever whatever
you are it's a bit of gambler to go to I guess listen I can guarantee you
the equivalent of your one will be top notch the rest yes in your luck you know what I mean
you know exactly what I mean so once the one guarantee might be definitely have
but we'll play the responses thank you Steve responders all but I didn't know it's not a nice metal okay
maybe that's an edition of your one the one more thing okay
approximately how many voters are you able to fulfill in June
I will not tell the number because we are not telling the
we have a lot of students of reservation and right smell the capabilities of the factory in the South
that are going to be yes that you order wait for so whenever
you will be sending the culvert actually amounts of water the outset
it's a first come first serve things isn't going to president Umm
it's just my you know if you want to if you want to have it as fast as possible
if you don't care waiting for some of the time
and maybe you want to wait for your views of people or whatever
it's just wave I mean there's no pressure honestly
someone else will buy and and someone else going said more have it
so definitely no worries in the world but you know that's going to want to be the first ones
I think that's why you did F2 your reset to receive that email it's recommended
Texan will inform everybody about year one and he's number 14 II
will leave my phone number please call me once the order is open
listen listen I know I'm I'm I'm very close to you guys in the community but I'm not a receptionist
okay I called for three people who reserve and did it so you know you're okay it's open maybe crank all
that would be nice so so again recount first orders ebay first deliveries in June
solely connected June right after that in Las Vegas 21st till 23rd of June flight seem expo write down these things
don't forget I will check different forget all right
where 89 people can we Craig a hundred and seems like so close yet so far away correct
so by the way now when the lead three letter will be about OK so by the way
it's something like we'll discuss something correct
what will actually be happening on some new connect
because you know it's a big deal so the Sonic Connect is planned the following
will probably start at 10:00 AM and the first half of the day will be dedicated completely
to some new VR1 and some new 3.0 platform update
because for those who don't know some of their space is a virtual reality platform
and some of your one is our PCVR headset so not only we are preparing something
we are wondering is we have also been working for one .5 drinking years
on this completely new revamp platform called Soming Space 3.08
and we will you know will dedicate a lot of keynote speeches
for the platforms Floyd's capabilities obviously will dedicate
a lot of genos which is about so many one and it's capabilities so first half of the day all the summit connect
will be fully dedicated to summon space crawling either software products or hardware products
that's the half of the day that will have some lunch and stuff so that we fool it
and there will be some probably surprises in between in some show
and the 2nd holiday will be the day of the kilos of our partners like w
Even with this material it's harder to engineer just give me one second
So yes it will be limited and it will be more expensive than the one right right
next to this information i'll tell you that
the transducing version will be only available in full variance
so eye tracking mixed reality and hand tracking will not do translucent variant
of any other variant so only the full one would be available for in this
I don't know in this so what else do we have here about the so blender Annan says
is this starting I think already answered that question in the past there
is 1899 is including our V8 no it's excluding ad we don't quote
I don't see any company coding numbers which are included
so 1899 is excluding the 18 Youth questions running good questions here going again and say
for second life OK so I'm assuming innovations are coming later
I said we've done an incredible work in the need which has eliminated I would say 90% of my employees like agents
it's at a point where if you don't look for it and only you would not see it was he
and every headset has some American regulation I see an Apple vision probe on questry fiscal
on Facebook emma Pico every hat said you have chromatic information e urge news
like Tesla soon like links and like high provision and then then you come in partners
who work with us they will be having keynote speeches for for what they do how we work together
what they do what they announce and they say that so while they will be doing keynotes
you will also be able to try their ones you'll be able to try to test this here
you'll be chipping inside the links and so all this kind of sometimes
what I'm interesting things happening in in that
so we are crazy we're aiming for the week day right now
but everything is in play right now again it
depends on the venue so we'll see some new space stream inside
some new space no newspapers will have impacted some space page in every world will have a dedicated base
where people will be able to watch the whole stream
the whole stream inside DR streaming to use to
and we will also be streaming in most probably several languages um
and we we will will have you know we'll have a very professional crew
probably will do even better than we did in the past I think in the past great
so we'll have quite a bit of cameras different angles we'll have a crane camera moving camera and stuff like that
so lots of lots of interesting stuff will be happening it will be very high end event
and in a celebration of XR like VR hardware and of course they are software
So what was the questions that first of all I have to add to it again reiterate
I think someone will be trying to ask like ohh why there's no use of each other
so first of all again I have to reach right now you didn't notice that he is how
we're not zero we have probably anything else again for us right now is
you know something you want to send more devices out now but you want us
then the only questions what does make sense either they will come right
before someone connect do their videos released during this some new connect
and then it's they for some new connect obviously
because you know we've created they can you know to experience the date with all of us
and meet all of you as well or if we find them right now they will have to fly back
and then they'll they'll have to come back personally predict
which is more complicated so that's the basic dilemma in main dilemma for for that
that's one way or another the controversy will give you will give you
their their opinions and you know you have a lot of data
you already have a lot of data points for VR1
that will have a bit more before you start ordering Yahoo Stevie were actually sorry
you actually do convert me into more becoming more similar to the honest satellites
we see in the edition of this was in Yes I enjoy IIII enjoy listening of course
I want I do play it but my master chief 300 he decided to stop working with the four speed legs
so I don't have force and bring it back to it and store
actually it's too aggressive really too aggressive
yeah I'm fine my kids were also playing the story my older son
if he likes to race with me or I don't allow him to race two options for the purposes of
you know of city next set of times like kinda name race
and he was like once they had me or one of the office and
can I raise but I instrument you can and he's like they have V-1 here like
nah you'll be racing in like no I don't want I will wait for you
then next and he's like he's like okay I wanna I wanna you know can I
can I erase I was like yeah he's like do I have your one here
I was like yeah he's like okay I mean here's a peaky dude right now
so yeah so so so that's that's that and I like racing in LIP lights
in elite dangerous crisis native who was someone cheeky here assumed Adam crisis will be revealed on the orders
will not reveal prices before the orders will go like
so no no price OKI guess that's how we have twenty-one 40 cents in this night
now you guys ready for the one more thing let's just show you that one more thing
you will all go and watch it and then we'll discuss it and I'll tell you a little bit more let me do it so I will I will post
no no no no no I will post simply post link watch that one second and I will you little individuals this ready everybody
I wanna see here only yes unless see yes are you ready to see this one
I'm not saying I'm ready i'm prepared ohh yes ohh it's not enough few more few more few more yes OK
I trust you I trust you you got you got no OK as public your eyes close your eyes clo
Very pretty very very pretty 0 my god 0 I was like oh my goodness so is it more expensive professor question
wait first watch I will ask I will answer questions after you all watch
Amazing I don't I only see the hydraulic things okay fair enough but it's not for everyone
okay there's some questions coming in i'll be answering the question
make sure that you watch it if you know once everybody is back
we'll of course don't forget to like that by the way like why the video and yeah comments
leave the comment let's let's kick the freaking youtube algorithm
say something nice or whatever you want to say let's do you know say something for you to be too like
what the hell is going on there what does this thing Listen we'll be answering some question
thank you darkest night your legend true legend and I really mean it se your eyes close your eyes
OK ready 3 to 1 go watch and come back when you watched and I wanna hear your thoughts
3 to one about you you know it's the warping is to be done in a way that it's either bothers you
it doesn't bother you so if you want it doesn't bother me and I really want in that
but you know there's no shifts all the cars the tracking quality is not affected
on the translation version you know all this day like otherwise
we'll bring the translation conversion in there and be technical problem
it's exactly the same perfect we are one but it has its amazing looks
and only see it when you see it from the sides because we didn't show you the sides
but we showed you the information anyways just say one little 6 is on that little 16
anyways Lexie see Oh I forgot I forgot I forgot I forgot
OK for those who love translucent version I am hosting here pictures
which you can use one is Twitter cover so you can change your Twitter cover for this
and few pictures if you want to use some share the year share the news
or pictures can be updated of course there'll be loads of update
it's coming through the art from support this helps it with updates
and I'll talk about this a little bit more in detail After somebody finished
not before Solarconnect just to make sure that everybody understand that how I think
they mean something in space lenka and then we have our own implementation of eye tracking
we have our own eye tracking which by the way the algorithm is moving completely open source at least
and everyone will be able to do whatever they want with a clip right now
they are tracking words and it works really well and we are going to be updating it
from our own engineering points of drunk life and the handset that we have already taken
which works and fully independently works fixed or fully fixed rendering works with the eye tracking
or for many different rewards we can you can actually you know close your eyes
and by the way as as as Steve also tested and we have it in software
whatever you can regulate how big is the introduction when they run in the
middle where your eyes are looking how big is the whole field of that resolution
and it's wrong so you can kind of decide what you run there
and how you want to have it
customization of the software is one of the strongest parts
of this you can do and change everything in this headset
like betray has how many combinations you can do with that
and just not open source they have a 3D model is full care models
after something connect after the orders will open for general public data for purchase
at the beginning of orders no just look looking through the stuff
wait I want to change my profile picture of Twitter to this new one second
Twitter is open yes yes employee bonus why is so nice excited noises why are you saying that and you made it with
OK so I don't know so that is weird what's what's your code next to my keyboard resembled in the past ronnie
can't stop and accurately anything miracle for that you will have to know differently than schools offer for that Indian Indians
by the way those who want you know we have sharpenings which again sorry to see that I'm always waiting for that
see what the ones I see but that's Steve loves it I love our shopping the English shopping for the house
it was an ASMP organization another sharpening which I mentioned in the latest studio
about the latest video studio about some normal as well there's something new or something new
and you will see how would the microphones CR1 has either social imaging to increase the quality yes
the microphones only year one of video and the microphone's on your 1 is 2 stereo microphone on here one
why don't we Steve has there is there is a hardware flowing so it's popping
this won't be obviously going on if you see my ss microphone release and other 100 pieces
there's no only you know microphone always actually very good I don't hear will be incredible here
and I don't know I don't know okay so I will find out for the trains also OK
they will have a look at those people who are waiting on 3.0 minutes to turn checking this
where's the final update when to do this court link no waitero okay
I don't know how to answer that question guys If you have anymore questions
I'm happy to try to answer them wireless addon in the future possible but no comment on whether and how but everything is possible yes
the second cable is needed for the pass through did you sell base stations in your are
not probably at the beginning but with the tensions there will be signed base stations
Angry about it i'm not sure actually I have to I tasked our engineers where they're like
never done that myself so interesting question i'll I'll ask i'll try to get some answers
yeah up to date we'll get into those we'll be we'll be we'll be selling on Twitter
it's here i'll be here okay so I think we've For us right now number one number two
theoretically is it possible to do something like that with VR1 cameras theoretic it's possible
is it priority for us to do some kind of no it's not because we have other things we want to do before we release
so no update on that is nothing nothing we're kind of doing that
but I'd be extremely worthy will be actually updated before the release of what for example Steve is seeing right now
and actually only before this we'll be updating mixed reality throughout the lifetime
but even before this we're expecting one more update on this other side
which will improve actually mixing already quite a bit
and do all the other ones have this same table connection
so no they don't because if you the mixed reality one has additional cable on the right side
so normally you have the cable on the left side 1 cable it's a hybrid optical cable
but the mix 31 has another one on the right side and that is for mixed reality
our cables are modular so you can screw them in and screw them in and then we're safe
you can take them off and on so if you for example for some certain parts you can just you know within 20 seconds
I'm screwing the cable and you know you can go you have the VR1 just for the one table
which is actually very nice and flexible and it's very long 6 meters
wait what is is the Mr Floyd's in love with us still steve how did you like that
you never told me anything on the cable how do you like the cables
because I like to watch how do you like this how do you like to screw in the cable
actually because you're not only screwing the mixture of the cable we're on purpose we should be with group cables
I want you to clear in help us share the wisdom with the community but he's not here anymore
is it nice and flexible on Finn it's Ethel's hybrid table can get and it's flexible yes yes
it doesn't tangle too much with each other like it doesn't battle itself you know what I mean the in
this cable that's prone to a loving itself a bit too hard sometimes yes
we're still 65 to 65 not 65 people at 65 people it's getting it's getting it's getting right here
OK I'm sorry it's getting the high tracking
open source release will happen most probably between some connect
and first student for students shipped that's my expectation
maybe slightly later but yeah now it's I would still expect
June will be the date the third party once on our own so
obviously we're not producing the playstation

I know exactly what engineers did and why they have this
but we're preparing a video with Arthur for my provision
