<h2>Somnium VR1 Ultimate Edition Judged</h2>

<dl><dt><details><summary><i>disclaimers</i></summary>
<dd>I am NOT a VR headset expert.
<br>I have played with <a href=https://blekenbleu.github.io/microscope/>photomicrography</a> for over 20 years.
<br>I have over 25 years professional experience
<br> &emsp; finding and fixing image processing artifacts.
<br>Applying the same scrutiny to image quality<br>&emsp; for hobbies as work would be masochistic.
<br>Samsung Odyssey was my first headset;
<br>VR1 replaced HP Reverb.
</details>
<dt><br>Clarity claims are meaningless.
<dd>Edge-to-edge clarity claims lack credibility.
<dt>Uniformity
<dd>My VR1 has neither objectionable mura nor vignetting.
<dt>Black level
<dd>I mainly use VR1 for <a href=https://www.overtake.gg/forums/assetto-corsa.130/>Assetto Corsa</a> in daylight;
<br>black levels e.g. in <a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1073390/Aircar/>Aircar</a> are acceptable.
<br>(Human vision is highly compromised in low light).
<dt>Sharpness
<dd>VR1 has good brightness and contrast everywhere.<br>
Text resolution decreases noticeably in outer half of lens radii.
<br>Aberrations and artifacts increase appreciably in outer third.
<dt>VR1 does not resolve 90 x 600 text characters,
<dd>cannot productively replace dual 2560x1600 40-inch monitors.
<dt>VR1 geometric distortions are unobtrusive in sims and games
<dd>but <a href=pupil_swim.htm>noticeable</a> in e.g. virtual desktop text windows.
<dt><a href=HandTrack.htm>Hand tracking</a> is OK, once working,<dd> but is not <i>yet</i> supported by software <i>interesting to me</i>.
<dt><a href=eyeTrack.htm>Eye tracking</a> works reliably <i>for me</i>,
<dd>with high contrast between pupils and irises
<br>and prescription lens inserts.
<dt>VR1 face mask does not fit me.
<dd>I use a <a href=strap.htm#BOBOVR>modified BOBOVR M2 Plus</a>
<br> without face mask in subdued lighting.
<dt>Mixed reality cameras are adequate in subdued lighting.
<dt>I have not used VR1's microphone.
<dt><br>Having used neither beta nor <a href=Update1yr.htm>1 Year Update</a> code;
<dd>I await positive feedback from the next update.
