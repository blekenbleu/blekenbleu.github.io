<h2>paraphrase of discord Stage Sep 20 VR1 update</h2>
<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2ezTr-h9dA><b>video</b></a><br><br>

VR1 manufacturing proceeds in stages of different durations,<br>
 &emsp; not a continuous assembly line:<ul>
<li>incoming parts inspection
<li>eyeboxes: longest and most complex stage,<br>
   with and  without eye tracking,
<li>device component preassemblies, e.g. frames, boards
<li>final assembly
<li>QA
<li>boxing and shipment</ul>
This last 1.5 weeks finished certain amount of eyeboxes<br>
 - much better yield and assembly rate than before, quite a lot, still not to plan.<br>
Next week: board preassembly, then final.<br>
First assembled devices being ready to ship by end of September.<br>
Authorities do not have certification paperwork yet ... but soon.<br>
FCC certification ID label printing has begun;  cool ID numbers..<br>
Perhaps both EU and US certification paperwork completion nearly the same time.<br>
Eyebox assembly speed and yield are both improving.<br>
Artur spends 15-20 minutes per VR1 on post-QA checks.<br>
Next video probably at first shipments.<br>
Logistics team already prepared list of first recipients.<br>
Plan for rapid ramp-up in October.<br>
VR Optician will start soon, separately announced.<br>
Prusa is printing modified side cable holders.<br>
Preparing a small download portal (e.g. for 3D models).<br>
VRFSG and Shodah have release candidate software.<br>
Some video being aired this weekend.<br>
November update with improved performance and features.<br>
Japan market demand will be addressed.<br>
Currently OpenXR supports real time FoV pruning<br>
OpenVR real time pruning is coming.<br>
Anything interesting updates from the factory next week probably by discord.<br>
