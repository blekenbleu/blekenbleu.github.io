<h2>Somnium VR1 - December 2024</h2><dl>
<dt>Some UK customers orders were shipped
<dd>and eventually received, after sorting DHL tax collection issues
<dt>FCC requested one specific Somnium VR1 re-measurement.
<dd>Somnium delivered a VR1 to a German lab Monday for that;
<br>FCC now needs no additional input from Somnium
<dt>Somnium began producing VR1s for U.S. customers.
<dt>VR1 Tool 1.0.3.43
<dd>1)Final fix for flashing black stripes while using SteamVR driver.<br>
2) Fixed tracking initialization issues in OpenXR applications.<br>
3) Added option to disable spacewarp functionality (Rendering page).<br>
4) Added color enhancer option for mixed reality. (MR Exposure page).<br>
 &emsp; More flexibility for settings.<br>
5) Improved default mixed reality exposure values.<br>
6) Fix for OpenXR DirectX12 compatibility issues.<br>
<dt>Somnium VR1 batch 4
<dd>Production complications preempted MR model production,<br>
with some early July orders instead being fulfilled for Classic (VR only)<br>
 and other customers with only eye and/or hand tracking options.<br>
 Batch 4 was the largest and with highest yield to date,<br>
with between 90 and 95% passing Artur's post-QA inspection.
<dt>18 Dec batch (5) is to be the last in 2024 and mostly MR units
<dd>no indication when FCC VR1 approval will be official<br>
AMD GPU support seems unlikely for VR1 MR versions,<br>
with support for other versions still problematic.<br>
A test version of VR1 tool is being made available<br>
to the single current VR1 owner with AMD GPU (and skills).<br><br>

A software release next week may address microphone audio popping,<br>
for which, being intermittent, fix confidence is problematic.<br>
A major OpenXR upgrade is planned for January,<br> along with production reaching full capacity.

<dt>VR1 tool installation
<dd>after reading that actual hardware attachment is not required<br>
- initial installation succeeded, but<br> &emsp; that version immediately detected and attempted to install updates.<br>
-updating froze twice:<br>
<img width=600 src=https://www.overtake.gg/attachments/checking-jpg.804972/><br>
-Workaround was to restart Windows 11.<br>
- for completeness, Nvidia (Studio) driver update (by NVIDIA App)<br>
 &emsp; also rarely goes well, requiring restart to get displays working correctly<br>
- an unusual display configuration may be to blame
<dt>open source data planned for January with new Somnium SDK, 72 + 120 hz and pipeline release
<dd>local dimming will follow that.
