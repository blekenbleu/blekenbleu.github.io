<h2>VR eye strain</h2>
<dl><dt>Eye strain is a <i>consequence</i> of several factors to which folks have wildly different sensitivities.
<dd><b>Binocular overlap</b> is that field of view <i>seen by both eyes</i>.
<br> &emsp; 3D perception works only within this region.
<br> &emsp; Some folks report discomfort when this FoV fraction is relatively small (e.g < 75%)
<dd><b>View out of focus</b> (or near focus limit for [e.g. older] folks with limited
	<a href=https://www.allaboutvision.com/eye-care/eye-anatomy/accommodation/>accommodation</a>)
<dd><b>Wrong IPD</b>, impacting ability to comfortably fuse binocular vision.
<dt><br>Eye strain provocations increase
with pupils outside lens'

<dt>Getting users' pupils in VR lenses' eye boxes may require
<dd> <b>modifying or replacing provided head strap and/or face mask</b>.
<dt>Many prospective users, expecting plug-and-play, are unprepared to improvise...

<dt><br>Low IPD can be problematic for headset optics with small exit pupil<dd>and lenses that collide with nose at small IPD settings.
<dt>Users' IPD have no direct impact on binocular overlap,
<dd>so long as IPD setting can center headset exit pupils on your pupils.
<dt>Optics with larger exit pupils allow folks to "cheat" binocular overlap vs total FoV
<dd>by tweaking location of their pupils relative to lenses' exit pupils
<br>by increasing or decreasing IPD settings:
<br> &emsp; eyes nearer inner edges of exit pupils increase FoV <i>while decreasing 3D FoV</i>
<dt>If your eyes *feel weird* after removing VR headset
<dd>focal distance, eye relief and/or IPD are/is probably off..
<dt>Stress becomes strain only when uncomfortable.
<dd>In practice, some folks can tolerate significant IPD maladjustment
<br><i>with some headsets</i>,
 to increase either measured FoV or binocular overlap
<dt><br><b>Brighter and sharper headsets</b>, typically those with aspheric optics,
<br><b>stimulate strong focus and binocular fusion responses</b> in users' visual systems,
<dd>increasing likelihood of discomfort for users' pupils not centered in lens <a href=eyespot.htm>eyeboxes</a>,
<br>as well as sensing artifacts not detected in dimmer and less sharp scenes.
