<pre>Don't worry.. Happened to me also the very first time connecting..
<font color=red><b>Just click the reset button</b></font> [in VR1 Tool]
or unplug and replug USB, <font color=red><b>then rerun wizard</b></font>..
Alternatively, manually run the Ultraleap installer
inside the program files folder manually
or via the software tab.. So much options</pre>
<dt>VR1 Tool Settings -> Software
<dd>- Disable OpenXR Runtime

<dt><b>Grey image in VR1?&nbsp; No lighthouse tracking!!</b>
<dd>Virtual Desktop and Mixed Reality will work, but probably not much else...
<br>- my single <a href=BaseStation/index.htm>base station</a> is seemingly defective...

<dt><details><a name=first><summary></a>my first impressions</summary>
(based only on Virtual Desktop and Mixed Reality - defective base station):
<dd><i>Not too good</i>, but:&nbsp;
<b>per Artur, CEO</b> <i>21 Feb 2025</i>:<pre>...50% is already a huge sweet spot.
Image never can stay fully crisp across the whole field of view.
VR1 has one of the biggest sweet spots on the market already. 

I recommend giving the headset at least a week.
As mentioned by several people above this will become much better
 when you dial in for your settings</pre>
<b>Per dman9971</b> </i>21 Feb 2025</i>:<pre>The blurring I see is from where the binocular overlap occurs.
The blurring of the inside edge of my left lens
 lands near the center of my right eye's view,
and the blurring of the inside of my right lens lands
 near the center of my left eye's view.
I only see the blurring in a way that is troublesome when both eyes are open.
 lol (obviously the way it's actually used).
My experience has been that I can eventually get over this
 by learning to refocus as I pan my eyes around inside the headset.
Since this is not something I had to do with my Index,
 this did seem ridiculous at first - especially in such an expensive headset,
but I have to admit that the clarity is amazing when I overlook the blurred areas
 - which is possible with time.</pre>
<dt><b>somnium</b> did not appear in SteamVR <b>Manage SteamVR Add-Ons</b>
<dd>Installing VR1 software was suggested..
<br>- since already installed, uninstalled, downloaded and attempted reinstallation
<br> &emsp;  - installation immediately tried to update, which hung...
<br> &emsp; - reboot was interrupted by Windows installing 24H2...
<br> - reinstallation failed;&nbsp exitted and launched update installation manually.
</details>
<dt> - <a href=mine.htm><i>My preparation and collateral software installation steps</i></a>
<dt><br>Comfort
<dd>Adjust headstrap for comfortably <i>tight</i> fit.
<br>With substantial inertia and without good fit, VR1 moves relative to eyes.
<br>- If at any time you feel unwell or uncomfortable in VR1,
<br> &emsp; <font color=red>take a break and rest until you feel better</font>.
<dt>Maintenance Rules
<dd>Use soft dry microfiber cloth to gently clean headset surfaces.
<br><font color=red>Use neither chemicals nor abrasive cleaners.</font>
<br>- for lens cleaning, use the included lens-specific cloth <font color=red>with NO chemicals</font>.
<br>- regularly confirm and maintain VR1 cleanliness
<dt>Radio Frequencies
<dd><code>2402-2480MHz &nbsp; 2.1mW</code>
