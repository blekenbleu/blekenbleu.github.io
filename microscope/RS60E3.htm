<title>Canon RS-60E3 remote switch</title>

<h3>Remote shutter release</h3>
Canon's 90D is my first DSLR to NOT use their N3 remote shutter connector.<br>
It instead uses so-called E3 or N3, a 2.3mm (3/32") TRS phone connector.<br>
Neither inline N3 nor mini stereo female jacks are readily available,<br>
and the only converter cable found was more expensive than an E3 remote,<br>
making a single remote for both not economic.<br>
However, I lucked into 4 original (but used) Canon RS60-E3 remotes<br>
for less than new clone price, with many clone reviews complaining<br>
about lack of tactile feedback between focus and shutter press.<br>
Canon's RS60-E3 also turns out usefully smaller than their TC-80N3 or many clones:<br>

Two notches in RS60-E3 bodies are seemingly for cable storage:<br>

<br>
My RS60-E3s lacked <a href="Images/rs60e3.pdf">instruction sheets</a>,
also not found on Canon's website.<br>
<br>
No YouTube review videos seemed to get this simple device right,<br>
either incorrectly suggesting that it uses a battery, works with <i>all</i> Canon DSLRs,<br>
or is unnecessary for cameras with touch screens.<br>
In fact, many times I want neither to glance away from the viewfinder<br>
nor touch the LCD for exposures when using Live View.<br>
<br>
Canon has seemingly discontinued this remote, preferring to sell either IR or RF remotes.<br>
While I occasionally use a tiny Bluetooth remote to trigger iPhone's camera,<br>
I do not care to carry around an easily misplaced RF remote pair, both liable to dead batteries,<br>
much less an IR remote that is likely problematic in bright sunlight and blind from many angles.<br>
<br>
Since usefully smaller than N3 remotes, I will get a cheap N3 cable to repair the faulty RS60-E3.<br>

<a href="https://support.usa.canon.com/kb/index?page=content&id=ART175443">Canon's web page for 90D-compatible remotes</a>
 lists but shows neither RS-60E3 nor BR-E1.<br>
If they cared, their page might look more like this:<br><hr>
