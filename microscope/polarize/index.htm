I was reminded of this effect while observing a razor blade painted black using darkfield EPI illumination.<br>
Some paint had flaked off the blade, causing specular reflections.<br>
Applying cross-polarization substantially eliminated them, while white plastic beside the blade was still bright.<br>
Cross-polarization seemingly is more expedient and portable than most diffuse illumination schemes.
