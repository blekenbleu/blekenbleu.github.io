I was reminded of this effect while observing a razor blade painted black using darkfield EPI illumination.<br>
Some paint had flaked off the blade, causing specular reflections.<br>
Applying cross-polarization substantially eliminated them, while white plastic beside the blade was still bright.<br>
Cross-polarization seemingly is more expedient and portable than most diffuse illumination schemes.

 &amp Whole Wave Plates<br> to Alter the Colouration of Polarized Light Photomicrographs</a></h3>
Circular polarization puts a 1/4 wave plate orientated at 45 degrees,<br>
<a href="https://www.newport.com/n/introduction-to-waveplates">so that equal amounts of fast and slow waves are excited</a>.<br>
Less obviously, 1/4 wave plates in neutral gray circular polarizing filters must be 1/4 wave <i>over visible</i> wavelengths,<br>
while separate 1/4 waveplates are typically 1/4 <i>at one</i> wavelength, provoking colors even at 45 degrees.<br>

<b>According to the McCRONE group,</b></a> "The Senarmont compensator consists of an accurate<br>
 1/4 plate oriented so that one of its vibration directions, usually the high index (slow direction),<br>
 is parallel to the polarizer vibration direction (not at usual 45 degrees for 1/4 compensator)."<br>

"Normally these compensators would sit above the objective,
 but this leaves very little in the way of experimentation<br>
 due to the small slots for retardation plates on most polarizing scopes
 [or none at all on biological scopes modified<br> for polarizing use],
 and the quality of the material itself is of lesser importance
 not being directly after your favourite objective; &nbsp;plastic retardation plates
 or poor quality mica can deteriorate the image if placed above the objective<br>
 [in the retardation slot if fitted], it certainly does on my microscope."<br>

See specifications included. Made in USA by a top optical manufacturer.<br>
Fully Laminated - 0.8mm thick. Rigid - will not bend.<br>
Its thickness provides rigidity for self-standing applications.<br>
<br>
Note: Since many of our buyers after making an order and receiving our polarizing filters<br>
begin farming to find microscope slides with polarizing capability we did the following:<br>
We included in this set a polarizing crystal microscope slider.<br>
This bonus is represented by an Acetaminophen, Orange G, Safranin O or Potassium Ferricyanide microscope slide. (ONE Slide)<br>
Since we depend by our supplier capabilities unfortunately we don't know which crystal will be included in the set.

We attached a detailed specification page showing all features, components<br>
and fabrication technology. Please see second attached picture.<br>
<br>
We included in this sale as a bonus - a crystal polarizing microscope slide<br>
with a birefringent chemical available at the time of sale.<br>
In this way you can check the quality of our product right after receiving it.<br>
<br>
Note: In our store we have listed two types of Lambda retaining plates:<br>
Group one: Laminated and Group two: Glass Mounted.<br>
Even same type of item - Quarter Lambda, for example interferometric has same value as Glass mounted quarter Lambda plates,<br>
visual some differences are noticed due to the technology used.<br>
Laminated plates are manufactured via hot lamination and at the line of contact between active layer<br>
and neutral protection layer there is a micrometric melted layer combining the last two.<br>
Visual this brings a color surplus in laminated lenses.<br>
In group two (full Lambda retaining plates) the effect is reversed but less noticeable.<br>
(For laser applications and special scientific research glass mounted retaining plates are usually the chosen choice.)<br>

Prinz 28mm Circular Polarizing Filters - 28mm threads<br>
I actually have 840 of these filters left but am listing a lower number.<br>
<br>
I have been in the photo industry and am now getting out.  I had these filters made a while back<br>
for the Nikon Coolpix cameras with the 28mm threads.  Canon camcorders and a variety of other cameras<br>
use the 28mm size.  I had many of them made and still have quite a few left.<br>
<br>
If you find you may need a quantity of the ones I have left just let me know and we can work something out.<br>
These are brand new in plastic packaging and are very good quality.<hr>
