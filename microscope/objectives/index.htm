<dt>Ordered 29 June 2022; &nbsp;received 13 July
<dd>Shipped in a proper objective jar, packaged in a bubble-lined envelope.<br>
The objective appears to be in a single solid metal casting<br>
and appears undamaged, but cannot focus in my AO 120 infinity microscope.<br>
FWIW, also cannot focus in (finite) Optiphot;  return requested.<br>
Front optic is recessed about 1mm into the casting.<br><br>
<dt>vendor offered $15 refund Jul 14
<dd>I tested further by holding it backward for far distant view (nearly infinite).<br>
Good infinity objectives can focus a far image on ground glass<br>
at nearly their working distance, but this cannot focus at any distance.<br>
It nearly focuses when touching ground glass, so negative working distance?<br>
Optical elements may be shifted inside, but I sense no looseness.<br><br>
<dt>15 Jul video demonstrating its inability to focus in comparison with another objective:
