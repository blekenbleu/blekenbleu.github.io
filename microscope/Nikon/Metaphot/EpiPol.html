<h3>Simplified Episcopic Polarization Equipment</h3>
The equipment, consisting of polarizer and analyzer slides,
is used in episcopic brightfield illumination with the VMS as well as VMD METAPHOT.
<h5>Nomenclature</h5>
<li>Polarizer slide, with lever rotatable about 20 degrees, fits in vertical arm slot.
<li>Analyzer slide with stop screws fits in horizontal head slot.
<h5>Assembly</h5><dl>
<dt>1) Attaching the analyzer slide
<dd>Remove rubber caps from horizontal filter slide slot openings in left and right arm sides.<br>
Unscrew stop screw from analyzer slide end nearer its empty hole and fully insert that slide into the right side horizontal slot.
Reattach its stop screw.
<dt>2) Attaching the polarizer slide
<dd><b>For the VMS model</b><br>
Remove rubber caps from vertical filter slide slot openings in left and right arm sides.
<dd><b>For the VMD model</b><br>
After unscrewing either left or right stop screw from the glare prevention filter slide in the vertical slot, remove it.
<dd>Unscrew stop screw from polarizer slide end nearer its empty hole and fully insert that slide into the right side vertical slot.
Reattach its stop screw.

<h5>Polarization microscopy (Procedure with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicol_prism">crossed Nicols</a> position)</h5><dl>
<dt>1) &nbsp; Turn on the power switch for lighting the lamp.
<dd>Set the lamp voltage to 7-8 on the meter by turning the brightness control dial.
<dt>2) &nbsp; Manipulating the filter turret, bring the "B" filter into the optical path.
<dt>3) &nbsp; Push (for VMS) or Pull (for VMD) the mirror change-over knob on the microscope arm,
<dd>inserting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_splitter#Beam-splitter_designs">half-silvered mirror</a> into the optical path.
<dt>4) &nbsp; Place on the stage a specimen of comparatively high reflectance
<dd>(e.g. a first-surface mirror, polished metallic surface, IC surface, etc.),<br>
and bring it into sharp focus under the 10x objective.
<dt>5) &nbsp; Insert polarizer and analyzer into the optical path
<dt>6) &nbsp; Adjust <a href="https://www.manualslib.com/manual/1725578/Nikon-Optiphot-Pol.html?page=9#manual">interpupillary distance and diopter</a>
<dt>7) &nbsp; Adjust illumination intensity.
<dt>8) &nbsp; While viewing the focused surface thru the eyepiece,
<dd>rotate the polarizer for peak extinction.
<dt>9) &nbsp; Change to appropriate objective magnification and refocus.
<dt>10) &nbsp; Readjust brightness
<dt>11) &nbsp; Adjust aperture and field diaphragms.
<dd>Rotate the polarizer as appropriate.<br>
For releasing from polarized observation, draw out polarizer and analyzer slides.
