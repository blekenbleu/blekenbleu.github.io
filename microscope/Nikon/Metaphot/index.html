<h2>Nikon Metaphot</h2>
One of 3 microscopes in Nikon's <a href="https://sts.kahaku.go.jp/diversity/document/system/pdf/101_e.pdf">Microphot V series</a> (pg 68),<br>
 along with Biophot and Fluophot,
that in introduced <a name=CF>Nikon's <b>CF</b> system<br>
<img src="metaphot1976.jpg">
 with the following characteristics:</a>
<ol compact>
<li> Lateral chromatic aberration is corrected properly all the way from field center to edge.
<li> Lack of color changes at eyepiece field stops allows 100% effective field viewing<br>
     (conventional systems have red tinges inside of stops).
<li> No appreciable color changes around eyepiece graticule markings.
<li> Reduced longitudinal chromatic aberration for objective and eyepiece lenses.
<li> Objective and eyepiece lenses are each their own complete optical system<br>
     and can be applied to any field.
</ol>
Abbe compensation (intentionally introducing sufficient lateral chromatic aberration to balance) was adopted because otherwise correcting lateral chromatic aberration was difficult,<br>
particularly for high magnification objective lenses.<br>
This was resolved by dividing objective lenses into front and rear groups,<br> over-correcting the front group, then inversely correcting the rear group.<br>
<br>
Page 3 of <a href="https://krebsmicro.com/Nikon_CF.pdf">Nikon New CF LENSES</a> clarifies that CF means "chromatic-aberation-free".<br>
Differences among CF/CF N Plan Apochomat, CF/CF N Plan Achromat,<br>
and other CF objectives are on pp 11-13.<br>
Nikon's <a href="https://krebsmicro.com/mplan.pdf">CF OBJECTIVES 210mm TUBE LENGTH</a> catalog<br> describes those objections without addressing CF.<br>

That focus motor seems familiar from other microscope images, but is probably from ITP, not Nikon.<br>

<hr>
<i>received 23 Aug</i><ul compact>
<li>generic 160mm 10/20/40 objectives switched from 210mm M plan objects<br>
    although this Metaphot seemingly has nearer 160 than 210mm tube length..?
<li>vertical illuminator C thumbwheel was frozen
<li>trinocular slider is frozen
<li>(large) stage weirdly disassembled and missing a <a href="../stage/">crossed roller bearing rail</a>.
<li>lamp house diffuser lever was extremely stiff.
<li>condenser focus is frozen
<li>condenser carrier missing (not shown eBay images)<br>
    &nbsp Labophot condenser carrier liable to be repurposed...
</ul>
<br>
The base seems unmolested:<br>
 &nbsp; <img align=center src="base.jpg"><br clear=all>
The only optics are mirror and field aperture;  filter push-buttons have neither filters nor filter holders.<br>
A 3A fuse is evidently combined with 100-120 V switch;<br>
 nearly all electronics, except for a variable resister, meter, lamp,<br>
 toroidal power transformer and power resister, are in a black plastic module.<br>
That module probably uses <a href="https://www.homemade-circuits.com/how-to-use-triacs-for-inductive-loads/">an SCR triac</a>
(instead of Optiphot's power transistor),<br>
 modulating AC rather than DC.<br>
It might be replaceable by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LODGP2E">this AC dimmer/speed regulator</a>:<br>

<a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/144368341673">HLX FCR lamp</a> 12V 100W is supplied directly from a toroidal transformer winding via black wires;<br>
Another secondary winding supplies the meter via blue wires,</br>
and a power on indicator is wired across the primary winding.<br>

The field lens provides for a 48mm o.d. polarizing filter.<br>
A nominal 55mm camera filter has 57mm o.d.; a <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/353432335120">46mm camera filter</a> works here.<br>

<h3>Improvised condenser carrier</h3>
<img src="CondenserCarrier.jpg"><br clear=all>
Base of Metaphot stage carrier dovetail is about 111mm to field lens centerline<br>
and 60mm to face of condenser carrier dovetail.<br>
Labophot condenser fork center to vertical plate back is 48mm;<br>
need about 3mm shim, e.g. 1/8 aluminum to match 111mm..<br>
That 1/8 aluminum spacer can be drilled for Labophot condenser fork back plate 4 holes<br>
and Metaphotcondenser focus rack dovetail 2 holes.<br>
FWIW, Optiphot is 111mm both at field lens and condenser lens centers.<br>
<br>
<a href="../Trinoc/#type-tc-trinocular-microscope-head">Type Tc trincular head</a> will be modified for direct projection.<br>
Photo/prizm slider is frozen, fortunately in photo position.<br>
Metaphot objective to head flange is 73mm;<br>
Optiphot-66 with vertical illuminator is 103mm<br>
Optiphot with (17mm) DIC sliders and vertical illuminator is 118<br>
Trinoc F head adds another 80mm to photo tube M42 flange.<br>
Tc head less Nikon photo tube is about 110,<br>
seemingly making up for Metaphot missing 30mm..<br>
