<h2>Nikon Metaphot</h2>
One of 3 microscopes in Nikon's <a href="https://sts.kahaku.go.jp/diversity/document/system/pdf/101_e.pdf">Microphot V series</a> (pg 68), which also included Biophot and Fluophot,<br>
introduced <a name=CF>Nikon's CF system with the following 5 distinguishing characteristics.</a><ol compact>
<li> Lateral chromatic aberration is corrected properly from the center of the field all the way to the peripheral edge.
<li> There are no changes in color at field stops of eyepiece,
allowing 100% effective field viewing<br> (in the conventional system, there are red tinges inside of the stops).
<li> When a graticule is inserted into the eyepiece, there are no color changes around the graduated scale or numbers.
<li> Longitudinal chromatic aberration is improved for the objective lens and eyepiece.
<li>Both the objective lens and eyepiece are their own complete optical systems and can be applied to any field.
</ol>
The Abbe compensation method was adopted because it was difficult to correct lateral chromatic aberration,<br>
particularly for high magnification objective lenses. This was resolved by dividing the objective lenses into front and rear<br>
groups and over-correcting the front group, then inversely correcting the rear group.<br>
<br>
Page 3 of <a href="https://krebsmicro.com/Nikon_CF.pdf">Nikon New CF LENSES</a> clarifies that CF means "chromatic-aberation-free".<br>
Differences among CF/CF N Plan Apochomat, CF/CF N Plan Achromat, and other CF objectives are on pp 11-13.<br>
Nikon's <a href="https://krebsmicro.com/mplan.pdf">CF OBJECTIVES 210mm TUBE LENGTH</a> catalog describes those objections without addressing CF.<br>

<hr>
<i>received 23 Aug</i><ul compact>
<li>generic 160mm 10/20/40 objectives switched for 210mm M plan objects
<li>vertical illuminator C thumbwheel was frozen
<li>trinocular slider is frozen
<li>(large) stage weirdly disassembled, a dovetail strip is missing.
<li>lamp house diffuser lever was extremely stiff.
<li>condenser focus is frozen
<li>condenser carrier missing (not shown eBay images)<br>
    &nbsp Labophot condenser carrier liable to be repurposed...
</ul>
Focus motor is only 2-wire; not a stepper, probably DC for power assist.<br>
<img src="DC_focus_motor.jpg"><br clear=all>
<br>
The base seems unmolested:<br>
<img src="base.jpg"><br clear=all>
The only optics are mirror and field aperture;  filter push-buttons have neither filters nor filter holders.<br>
No fuse is evident in wiring; nearly all electronics, except for a variable resister, meter, lamp,<br>
 toroidal power transformer and power resister, are in a black plastic module.<br>
That module may use an SCR instead of power transistor.<br>
<br>
The field lens provides for a 48mm o.d. polarizing filter.<br>
A nominal 55mm camera filter has 57mm o.d.; 46mm camera filter should work.<br>

<h3>Improvised condenser carrier</h3>
<img src="CondenserCarrier.jpg"><br clear=all>
Base of Metaphot stage carrier dovetail is about 111mm to field lens centerline<br>
and 60mm to face of condenser carrier dovetail.<br>
Labophot condenser fork center to vertical plate back is 48mm;<br>
need about 3mm shim, e.g. 1/8 aluminum to match 111mm..<br>
That 1/8 aluminum spacer can be drilled for Labophot condenser fork back plate 4 holes<br>
and Metaphotcondenser focus rack dovetail 2 holes.<br>
FWIW, Optiphot is 111mm both at field lens and condenser lens centers.<br>
