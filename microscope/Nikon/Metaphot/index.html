<h2>Nikon Metaphot</h2>
One of 3 microscopes in Nikon's <a href="https://sts.kahaku.go.jp/diversity/document/system/pdf/101_e.pdf">Microphot V series</a> (pg 68),<br>
 along with Biophot and Fluophot,
that in introduced <a name=CF>Nikon's <b>CF</b> system<br>
<img src="metaphot1976.jpg">
 with the following characteristics:</a>
<ol compact>
<li> Lateral chromatic aberration is corrected properly all the way from field center to edge.
<li> Lack of color changes at eyepiece field stops allows 100% effective field viewing<br>
     (conventional systems have red tinges inside of stops).
<li> No appreciable color changes around eyepiece graticule markings.
<li> Reduced longitudinal chromatic aberration for objective and eyepiece lenses.
<li> Objective and eyepiece lenses are each their own complete optical system<br>
     and can be applied to any field.
</ol>
Abbe compensation (deliberately introducing cancelling lateral chromatic aberration)<br>
was adopted because alternatives were difficult,<br>
particularly for high magnification objectives. &nbsp To accomplish this,<br>
objectives were divided into over-corrected front and inversely corrected rear lens groups.<br>
<br>
Page 3 of <a href="https://krebsmicro.com/Nikon_CF.pdf">Nikon New CF LENSES</a> clarifies that CF means "chromatic-aberation-free".<br>
Differences among CF/CF N Plan Apochomat, CF/CF N Plan Achromat,<br>
and other CF objectives are on pp 11-13.<br>
Nikon's <a href="https://krebsmicro.com/mplan.pdf">CF OBJECTIVES 210mm TUBE LENGTH</a> catalog<br> describes those objections without addressing CF.<br>

<h5>Biophot and Fluophot</h5>
Apparently use the same base as Metaphot, but different arms e.g. with removable objective turret.<br>
A Biophot manual is <a href="http://www.science-info.net/docs/Nikon/Nikon_Biophot.pdf">here</a>
Evidence of some evolution in design:<ul compact>
<li>metal focus knobs similar to Nikon S series, instead of Optiphot style.
<li>a Siedentopf with external trinocular tube brace
</ul>
160mm vs 210mm tube length implementation is unobvious; arm and turret depths appear the same...

<h3>Labophot condenser carrier repurposed for Metaphot</h3></a>
<img src="CondenserCarrier.jpg"><br clear=all>
<br>
Base of Metaphot stage carrier dovetail is about 111mm to field lens centerline<br>
and 60mm to face of condenser carrier dovetail.<br>
Labophot condenser fork center to vertical plate back is 48mm;<br>
need about 3mm shim, e.g. 1/8 aluminum, to match 111mm..<br>
FWIW, Optiphot is 111mm both at field lens and condenser lens centers.<br>
That 1/8 aluminum spacer was drilled for Labophot condenser fork bracket's 4 holes<br>
and Metaphot condenser focus rack dovetail's 2 holes.<br>
While Nikon uses metric hardware, available 8-32 flat head screws are a good fit to Labophot condenser fork mounting holes.<br>
Luckily, a long drill bit was available that fit those holes and cleared the fork.<br>
<img src="long_bit.jpg"><br clear=all><br><table><tr><td width=50%>
Since the long bit is dull,<br>drilling was completed using a shorter but sharper drill.<br>
<img width=100% src="short_bit.jpg"></td><td>

 &nbsp Sharp vision is not needed to note that<br>
 &nbsp the aluminum spacer is NOT square on the mount.<br>
<img width=98% align=right src="twisted.jpg"></td></td></table>
Many are fond of reciting "measure twice and cut once",<br>
somehow forgetting that only a single final measurement determines accuracy.<br>
In this case, all 4 screw holes accurately match condenser fork holes,<br>
while overall accuracy was compromised by both drill chuck runout and drill bit wander.<br>
Further, just as with e.g. Porsche twin turbo brake rotors that are far out of true from the factory,<br>
overall fit is determined by another mating,<br>
 in Porsche's case with rotor hats and in this case by another pair of screw holes<br>
mounting this spacer to Metaphot's condenser rack,<br>
where parallel between the Labophot condenser bracket and Metaphot condenser dovetail<br>
<i>was checked</i> before drilling the second of those holes:<br>
<img src="parallel.jpg"><br clear=all>

Clamping this aluminum spacer between condenser fork, dovetail and rack<br>
wants a pair of 3mm flat heat screws no longer than 17mm; &nbsp;M3 x 16mm were ordered.<br>
</p>
At its highest, top lens of Nikon LWD condenser would be about 14mm below stage top surface.<br>
In the Optiphot with slide stage, that LWD condenser gets field aperture parfocal with calibration target about 12mm below stage surface.<br>
As with Optiphot-66 getting parfocal using ELWD 0.3 condenser will be not problem,<br>
with top surface of condenser carrier fork about 83mm below stage surface.<br>
On the other hand, ELWD condenser lack of n.a. and aperture compromise objectives &gt; 5x.<br>
<br>
Nikon's condenser adapter adds 18mm height and retains condenser centering;<br>
putting Labophot condenser fork vertical flange at Metaphot condenser dovetail height<br>
when LWD 0.65 condenser top lens is flush with the oversized Metaphot stage top surface.<br>
Of course, being LWD, it need not be that high to focus the field aperture,<br>
but Abbe 1.25 and Achr 0.90 flip top condensers are also that (63-64mm) height.<br>
<i>9 Sept 2022</i><br>
3x16 flat head screws arrived the same day as BD head; <br>both were assembled to the Metaphot.<br>

As suspected, this head is not DIC and barely BD,<br> using a neutral density stop in the aluminum slider for darkfield.<br>
Knurled knobs on slider ends are merely stops to align darkfield stop or empty (brightfield) hole.<br>
BD thumbwheel, between condenser and field apertures,<br>
appears to be another aperture for stopping coaxial illumination.<br>
