<h3>Nikon Metaphot Trinocular Microscope 10/20/40x + CFW10x Eyepieces</h3>
One of 3 microscopes in Nikon's <a href="https://sts.kahaku.go.jp/diversity/document/system/pdf/101_e.pdf">Microphot V series</a> (pg 68), which also included Biophot and Fluophot,<br>
introduced <a name=CF>Nikon's CF system with the following 5 distinguishing characteristics.</a><ol compact>
<li> Lateral chromatic aberration is corrected properly from the center of the field all the way to the peripheral edge.
<li> There are no changes in color at field stops of eyepiece,
allowing 100% effective field viewing<br> (in the conventional system, there are red tinges inside of the stops).
<li> When a graticule is inserted into the eyepiece, there are no color changes around the graduated scale or numbers.
<li> Longitudinal chromatic aberration is improved for the objective lens and eyepiece.
<li>Both the objective lens and eyepiece are their own complete optical systems and can be applied to any field.
</ol>
The Abbe compensation method was adopted because it was difficult to correct lateral chromatic aberration,<br>
particularly for high magnification objective lenses. This was resolved by dividing the objective lenses into front and rear<br>
groups and over-correcting the front group, then inversely correcting the rear group.<br>
<br>
Page 3 of <a href="https://krebsmicro.com/Nikon_CF.pdf">Nikon New CF LENSES</a> clarifies that CF means "chromatic-aberation-free".<br>
Differences among CF/CF N Plan Apochomat, CF/CF N Plan Achromat, and other CF objectives are described on pp 11-13.<br>
Nikon's <a href="https://krebsmicro.com/mplan.pdf">CF OBJECTIVES 210mm TUBE LENGTH</a> catalog describes those objections without addressing CF.<br>
