<h2>Nikon Metaphot</h2>
One of 3 microscopes in Nikon's <a href="https://sts.kahaku.go.jp/diversity/document/system/pdf/101_e.pdf">Microphot V series</a> (pg 68),<br>
 along with Biophot and Fluophot,
that in introduced <a name=CF>Nikon's <b>CF</b> system<br>
<img src="metaphot1976.jpg">
 with the following characteristics:</a>
<ol compact>
<li> Lateral chromatic aberration is corrected properly all the way from field center to edge.
<li> Lack of color changes at eyepiece field stops allows 100% effective field viewing<br>
     (conventional systems have red tinges inside of stops).
<li> No appreciable color changes around eyepiece graticule markings.
<li> Reduced longitudinal chromatic aberration for objective and eyepiece lenses.
<li> Objective and eyepiece lenses are each their own complete optical system<br>
     and can be applied to any field.
</ol>
Abbe compensation (deliberately introducing cancelling lateral chromatic aberration)<br>
was adopted because alternatives were difficult,<br>
particularly for high magnification objectives. &nbsp To accomplish this,<br>
objectives were divided into over-corrected front and inversely corrected rear lens groups.<br>
<br>
Page 3 of <a href="https://krebsmicro.com/Nikon_CF.pdf">Nikon New CF LENSES</a> clarifies that CF means "chromatic-aberation-free".<br>
Differences among CF/CF N Plan Apochomat, CF/CF N Plan Achromat,<br>
and other CF objectives are on pp 11-13.<br>
Nikon's <a href="https://krebsmicro.com/mplan.pdf">CF OBJECTIVES 210mm TUBE LENGTH</a> catalog<br> describes those objections without addressing CF.<br>

<h3>Improvised condenser carrier</h3>
<img src="CondenserCarrier.jpg"><br clear=all>
Base of Metaphot stage carrier dovetail is about 111mm to field lens centerline<br>
and 60mm to face of condenser carrier dovetail.<br>
Labophot condenser fork center to vertical plate back is 48mm;<br>
need about 3mm shim, e.g. 1/8 aluminum to match 111mm..<br>
That 1/8 aluminum spacer can be drilled for Labophot condenser fork back plate 4 holes<br>
and Metaphot condenser focus rack dovetail 2 holes.<br>
FWIW, Optiphot is 111mm both at field lens and condenser lens centers.<br>
<br>
At its highest, top lens of Nikon LWD condenser would be about 14mm below stage top surface.<br>
In the optiphot with slide stage, that LWD condenser gets field aperture parfocal with calibration target about 12mm below stage surface.<br>
As with Optiphot-66 getting parfocal using ELWD 0.3 condenser will be not problem,<br>
with top surface of condenser carrier fork about 83mm below stage surface.<br>
On the other hand, ELWD condenser lack of aperture compromises objectives &gt; 5x.<br>
<br>
This condenser adapter adds 18mm height and retains condenser centering;<br>
this puts Labophot condenser fork vertical flange at Metaphot condenser dovetail hight<br>
when LWD 0.65 condenser top lens is flush with the oversized Metaphot stage top surface.<br>
Of course, being LWD, it need not be that high to focus the field aperture,<br>
but the Abbe 1.25 condenser and Achr 0.90 flip top are about that same (63-64mm) height.<br>
A <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/275419900351">34mm 1/4 lambda plate</a> will fit between this adapter and Nikon condensers; 36mm is too large.

Nikon sub-stage condenser adapter that will allow almost any condenser of another brand<br>
 with a lower opening of approximately 36.4 mm
to be fitted to the Nikon Labophot/ Optiphot/ Microphot/ Eclipse E400/ E600/ E800 and "CiL/ Ni series of microscopes.<br>
This is very handy if for example you have an Olympus darkfield condenser<br>
you would like to use on your Nikon, no problem!<br>
Brand new in box with a Nikon stock number 78604.

<h3><a href="../Trinoc/#type-tc-trinocular-microscope-head">Type Tc trincular head</a> will be modified for direct projection.</h3>
Photo/prizm slider is frozen, fortunately in photo position.<br>
Metaphot objective to head flange is 73mm;<br>
Optiphot-66 with vertical illuminator is 103mm<br>
Optiphot with (17mm) DIC sliders and vertical illuminator is 118<br>
Trinoc F head adds another 80mm to photo tube M42 flange.<br>
Tc head less Nikon photo tube is about 110,<br>
seemingly making up for Metaphot missing 30mm..<br>
