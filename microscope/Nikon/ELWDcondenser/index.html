<h4>iris diaphragm</h4>
Thread between ELWD condenser lens and dovetail ring has about 46mm (1.8") o.d..<br>
A <a href="../../iris37mm/">37mm iris diaphragm</a> separating them by less than 18mm should fit and still allow field aperture focus.<br>

<h4>Useful field</h4>
Using a 0.1mm/div calibration slide face down on the stage<br>
(so focused with M Plan 5x thru slide glass),<br>
the field aperture was shut down just enough to focus blades near field periphery viewed with CFWN 10x/20M ocular,<br>
with that diameter measuring about 3.6mm,<br>
corresponding to about 750 pixels in this first macro image before downscaling:<br>
<img src="first3.6mm.jpg">
<br clear=all>
.. which is with face-down calibration slide replaced by face-down ground glass.<br>
<br>
Fully opening the field aperture more than fills my approx 24mm improvised stage plate diascopic port:<br>
<img src="fullyOpen.jpg">
<br clear=all>
.. amounting to about 4650 pixels before downsampling.<br>
<br>
Attempting uniformity estimate this far off-axis was senseless.<br>

<h4>field uniformity</h4>
After "eyeballing" thru the photo port for filament alignment and focus,<br>
a Tamron 180mm f/3.5 macro lens was lined up and focused on a calibration slide<br>
thru Optiphot's arm hole with head and objective turret removed:<br>

<br clear=all><br>

Turning lamp voltage way down reduced lens flare<br>
so that calibration slide markings are distinguished. This is a 1:1 crop:<br>
<img src="widecrop.jpg">
<br clear=all><br>

.. and with gamma and contrast tweaked to accentuate nonuniformity:<br>
<img src="wc_mcmg.jpg">
<br clear=all><br>

Untweaked image background luminance varies from about 160/255 to 180/255 over the center 70mm diameter:<br>

<br clear=all>

<h4>Phase Contrast</h4>
<a href="../PhaseContrast/">Phase contrast turret</a> inserts between the illumination field lens and ELWD condenser:<br>
<img src="InvertedDiaphotPhase.jpg"><br clear=all><br>

To locate the turret beneath Optiphot condenser carrier,
a 52-48mm step-down is screwed in place of field lens ring,<br> with a 52-42mm helicoid:

.. and a 48-42mm step-down and 48mm extension tube to which turret clamps.
