<h3>Head banging</h3>
The quintuple RMS objective nosepiece turret used on my Optiphot<br>
interferes with corners of trinocular heads.<br>
<img src="OptiphotHeadBang.jpg"><br clear=all>
<br>
This occurs with neither binocular head nor quadrupal BD objective turrets.<br>
Practically, this is an issue with neither type T (regularly installed) or F,<br>
since the Optiphot is arranged for viewing from the left side.<br>
The F head, which requires rotating to switch between oculars and camera,<br>
would be problematic if oriented for viewing from front, rear, or right side.<br>
Other Optiphot quintuple nosepiece turrents on eBay have thinner plastic or metal outer rings;<br>
this one may have been intended for inverted scopes and is no problem<br>
when used with a vertical illuminator and M Plan objectives, but seems a peculiar oversight.<br>

<h3>Nikon Type F Trinocular Microscope Head</h3></a>
eBay item number: 392906516398<br>
Condition: &nbsp;For parts or not working<br>
Brand: &nbsp;Nikon<br>
Model: &nbsp;Type F<br>
<br>
This Nikon Type F Trinocular Microscope Head is in good cosmetic condition
with scuffs and scratches present.
<br>
I was able to smoothly turn the trinocular port to change the viewing
from the eyepieces to the port.<br>
The optics appear to be clear from a quick visual inspection.
<br>
I do not have the knowledge or equipment to fully test this unit,
so it is sold As-Is.

Since there are no optics in Type F head between its bottom flange
and the ISO photo port,<br>camera sensor is a "direct" shot
from objectives (ignoring vertical illuminator beam splitter and/or DIC prisms).<br>
<br>
An AO 10-120 tube lens seemingly provides equivalent corrections
for their infinity objectives;<br>no additional optics
are necessary for digital imaging to correct chromatic aberrations.<br>
Since designated AO photo relay optics are either rare or unavailable,<br>
tube lens <a href="../../AO/DIYphoto.htm">direct focus to camera sensors</a> seems worth attempting.
<a name="T"><h3>Nikon Type T Trinocular Microscope Head</h3></a>
<i>bundled with Optiphot-66</i> &nbsp
<img align=top src="../Images/bellows.jpg"><br clear=all>
<br>
Unlike the type F, type T (and type UW) have nearly the opposite of a tube lens
at their bottom flange,<br> creating 
<a href="../OptiphotInfinity">an approximate infinity space around beam splitter</a> for oculars and photo tube. <br>
Its removable photo tube chimney has nearly a tube lens at its bottom<br>
to convert back from that beam splitter space to focus for a photo relay lens. &nbsp
With that chimney removed,<br>
focusing a camera lens towards that nearly reversed tube lens yields images
of a strongly cropped field, <br>indicating <a href="../OptiphotInfinity">that space is <i>not really</i> infinity</a>.<br>
Chimney construction does not allow for camera sensor placement at that focal plane.<br>
<br>
The chimney has an internal aperture stop at its 50mm thread.<br>
Lip above 50mm thread to chimney bottom
(with 44mm female thread) is 49mm.<br>
Sadly, vertical illuminator extension for Optiphot-66 is 95mm long; &nbsp
it has useful diameter and threads...<br>

both configurations capture a larger FoV than do WF10X/23 oculars.

Based on 
<a href="https://www.microbehunter.com/microscopy-forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=11881">Sure Squintsalot</a>
's input, I tried direct projection to M6 mkII sensor from UW bottom lens:
<img src="UWdirectM6II.jpg"><br clear=all>
Focus required lifting objectives enough that should in theory degrade resolution,<br>
but more disasterously above 40X and 0.65 n.a..<br>
<br>
While the M6 II skyhook was in place, an M42 extension tube + helicoid was improvised for it,<br>
with a mount for the Surplus Shed 135mm achromat doublet improvised from a pair of rubber o-rings<br>
and 42-43mm, 43-37mm and 37-30mm filter adapter rings:<br>

.. leaving the lens recessed about 6mm (thickness of 37-30mm step-down):

.. for a net distance of about 115mm from M6 flange to 135mm lens front.<br>
While knurling o.d. on most M42 extension tubes is too large to pass 50mm thread in Trinocular T or UW chimneys,
some <a href="../../Pentax_tubes">old aftermarket automatic extension tubes for Pentax, etc</a>
will fit.<br>
As with the 7D, 5X field is magnified and cropped slightly relative to oculars:
