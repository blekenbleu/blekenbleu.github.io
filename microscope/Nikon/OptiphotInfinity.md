## Infinity-focused Optiphot EPI  
Nikon Optiphot EPI objectives were designed for 210mm tube length.  
Only "F" trinolar head focused objective rays 210mm;  
more common "T" heads have a pseudo-infinity space 
around their trinocular prism:

Nikon's chimney for CF PL has an M50 x 0.75 external thread and positive lens.  
Removing that chimney allows the infinite image to continue;   
a camera with 250mm telephoto lens focused at infinity:

... however those strongly vignetted images are magnified about 3X  
relative to oculars (image by iPhone):
