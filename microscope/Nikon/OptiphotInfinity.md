## Infinity-focused Optiphot EPI  
Nikon Optiphot EPI objectives were designed for 210mm tube length.  
Only ["F" trinolar head](F_trinoc) focused objective rays 210mm;  
more common "T" heads have a pseudo-infinity space 
around their trinocular prism:

Nikon's chimney for CF PL has an M50 x 0.75 external thread and positive lens.  
Removing that chimney allows the infinite image to continue;   
a camera with 250mm telephoto lens focused at infinity:

... captured these images:

... however those strongly vignetted images are magnified about 3X  
relative to oculars (image by iPhone):

# Other  
Other Optiphot infinity configurations
- Infinity objectives thru [trinoc "F" head](F_trinoc) to an infinity-focused [tube lens](../tube)  
  Infinity-based Eclipse heads [reportedly fit Optiphot dovetails](https://lavinia.as.arizona.edu/~mtuell/scopes/Eclipse.php).  
- Optiphot 100/150/200 were infinity scopes with otherwise seemingly incompatible infinity objectives,
  presumably NOT being CFI60.
