<h2>Nikon stage bearings</h2>
The Metaphot was delivered with its stage partially disassembled and missing a roller bearing rail.<br>
The good news: that missing rail is seemingly the same as Labophot and Optiphot x-travel stage rails,<br>
and an eBay seller lists those racks with rails.  Since I have a stage with stripped thread in its rail,<br>
this provides working replacements for both stages.<br>

<h3>Nikon Microscope Mechanical Stage X-rack for Labophot and Optiphot Series</h3>
eBay item number:&nbsp; <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/281567730299">281567730299</a><br>
Condition: Used<br>
<br>
Nikon x-travel mechanical stage part that includes a good rack, good roller bearing rails and good cosmetic verniers.<br>
If you have a stage mechanism that is damaged on a Nikon Labophot, Labophot-2. Optiphot or Optiphot-2<br> this is an easy fix.
Even a novice can replace this unit without much trouble. The sale is for one each as pictured.<br>

By now, I have enough experience to be aware that anytime something is described as "easy",<br>
then it will be nearly impossible and almost certainly not worth the hassle, particularly for software.<br>
In this case, it would have been impossible if @abednego1995 had not noted
<a href="https://www.microbehunter.com/microscopy-forum/viewtopic.php?t=6071#p91496">"These stages use cross-roller bearings"</a>, which meant nothing to me,
but Google found <a href="https://www.nbcorporation.com/basics-crossed-roller-bearings/">The Basics of Crossed Roller Bearings</a>:<br>

... without which I would have been doomed.<br>
<br>
A stage <i>must</i> be held on edge to assemble these slides and bearings.<br>

Optiphot stage X-rails will be reused in Metaphot ITP stage Y-rails:<br>
