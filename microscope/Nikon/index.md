## Nikon BD 210mm  
While my first microscopes were [American Optical Series 10s](https://user.xmission.com/~psneeley/Personal/Microscope.htm), because cheap plentiful and plentiful near me,  
they were also interesting because early popularizers of infinitity correction.  
That did not prevent me from also acquiring a [Nikon Apophot](https://www.microscopyu.com/museum/nikon-apophot-table-microscope),  
which was a massive frame with trinocular head using their highly popular [Model S](https://www.microscopyu.com/museum/model-s-microscope) optics.  
That Apophot was too large to move from KY, and I did not much stray from AO/Reichert microscopes
until concluding that:  
* their episcopic illumination was fundamentally flawed  
* considerably larger than RMS threads are wanted for darkfield epi objectives  
* fewer old optics in the path to camera sensors helps contrast and sharpness.  

... which suggests Nikon's 210mm CF Plan BD objectives.  
While Nikon's newer infinity offerings are more highly rated,  
they are also more expensive, since still current technology.  
The obvious frames for 210 BD objectives are Nikon's Optiphots,
which are better quality than contemporary Labophots.
Optiphot frames come in 4 flavors:
* IC inspection (-66, -77, [-88](https://www.microscopyu.com/museum/optiphot-88-ic-inspection-microscope) and 150), of which 150 uses infinity optics  
* Optiphot-2, which are fairly famous for [fragile white plastic fine focus gears](https://www.microscopesolutions.com/product-page/nikon-labophot-2-optiphot-2-te200-300-fine-focus)  
* Optiphot(-1), which used less plastic than Optiphot-2, but also 50W instead of 100W illumination  
  Although an vertical illuminator are often installed on Optiphot-1,2, the IC inspection frames
  have considerably stronger focus gears and stages with more space to examine solid objects.  
* Optiphot-200,300, which (like 150) uses infinity objectives, but on a frame more similar to Eclipse
