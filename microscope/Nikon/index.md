## Nikon BD 210mm  
While my first microscopes were [American Optical Series 10s](https://user.xmission.com/~psneeley/Personal/Microscope.htm)  
(because cheap and plentiful here),  
they were also interesting because AO pioneered infinity correction.  
That did not prevent me from also acquiring a [Nikon Apophot](https://www.microscopyu.com/museum/nikon-apophot-table-microscope),  
which massive frame used Nikon's highly popular [Model S](https://www.microscopyu.com/museum/model-s-microscope) optics.  
That Apophot was too large to move from KY,
instead using AO/Reichert microscopes until concluding that:  
* their episcopic illumination was "not ideal"  
* larger than RMS objectivess are wanted for bright darkfield epi  
* fewer old optics in paths to camera sensors help contrast and sharpness.  

... which suggests Nikon's [210mm CF Plan BD objectives](https://krebsmicro.com/mplan.pdf),  
which have [M26x0.75 threads](https://www.coinimaging.com/nikon_bd5.html).
While Nikon's newer infinity objectives are more highly rated,  
they are also more expensive, since still current technology.  
Obvious frames for 210 BD objectives are Nikon's Optiphots,
which are better quality than contemporary Labophots.
Optiphot frames come in 4 flavors:
* IC inspection ([-66](https://lavinia.as.arizona.edu/~mtuell/pdf/Nikon-Optiphot-66-Manual.pdf), -77, [-88](https://www.microscopyu.com/museum/optiphot-88-ic-inspection-microscope) and 150), of which 150 uses infinity optics  
* Optiphot-2, which are fairly famous for [fragile white plastic gears](https://www.microscopesolutions.com/product-page/nikon-labophot-2-optiphot-2-te200-300-fine-focus)  
* Optiphot(-1), which used less plastic than Optiphot-2, but also 50W instead of 100W illumination   
  Although vertical illuminators are often installed on Optiphot-1 and -2,  
  IC inspection frames have stronger gears and stages with more space to examine solid objects.  
* Optiphot-200 and -300, which (like 150) uses infinity objectives, but on frames more similar to Eclipse
