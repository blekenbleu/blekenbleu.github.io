## Nikon Optiphot Microscope

The Optiphot was introduced around 1979, inheriting some features from 1976 Metaphot and Biophot,  
with the same [CF](../Metaphot/#CF) optics but more options and some cost reductions, including lower illumination power.

## Received 9 June 2022  
Despite being advertised as a Labophot,  
tt is an Optiphot, with Nikon Optiphot plate on its arm.  
Plastic base pads are fine. 
Those tend to be problematic on Optiphot 2...  

The lamphouse was thankfully intact, having been removed as requested.  
Bulb lights; filament shows clearly in the field lens;  diffuser is missing...  
A cheap substitute was [ordered from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0041V9IX4).
![optical path](OpticalPath.jpg)  

Condenser carrier and rack are intact and working,  
but neither coarse nor fine stage focus knobs work.  

Bizarrly, power connecton for 12V bulb uses 110VAC plug and receptacle:  
![Optiphot 12VDC](Optiphot_12VDC.jpg)  
...although they match those on page 10 of [the Optiphot instruction manual](https://cmrf.research.uiowa.edu/sites/cmrf.research.uiowa.edu/files/nikon-optiphot-manual_0.pdf).  

Condenser carrier and rack are seemingly identical to those on the diaphot Optiphot 66;  
unlike the 66, its stop actually prevents running off its pinion.  
That carrier design seems odd; an upper U is rigid to the rack,  
with a screw that could anchor condensers to it, but a lower spring-loaded ring  
with two adjusting screws that presumably might be to center condensers,  
if they were tight in that floating ring and not anchored in the U...??  
![carrier bottom](bottom.jpg)  

Condenser and substage assemblies mount on a dovetail that  
is removable from the (broken) stage focus rack.

### Focus
Optiphot-1 fine focus differs from -66  
- -66 has a single 26:6 planetary gear driven from its (fragile plastic) fine focus gear (13:3), 
- -1 15:6 plastic planetary is driven from fine focus, driving via a plastic idler its 20:6 (25:3).  

![-1 left; -66 right](FineFocus.jpg)  
    *-1 fine focus on the left;  -66 fine focus is to the right, with its fine focus shaft*  

Those last (metal) gears' 6 cog sticks thru a large brass spacer/bushing plate  
to drive a first coarse focus coaxial sun gear,  
which smaller cog drives the coarse focus planetary gear,  
which small cog drive the coaxial focus pinion sun gear.

The -1 focus evidently had been already fiddled, because
its large brass spacer was only loosely threaded onto its coarse focus tube,  
and its first coarse focus sun gear was missing.

The -66 coarse focus tube has a retaining nut on the end without gears;
don't yet know about the -1; its large brass spacer/bushing plate is still  
tightly threaded on its coarse focus tube.

Both focus blocks are the same width,  
so presumably matching fine focus shaft lengths.   

### Condenser
Bought a [Zeiss 0.9 flip-top condenser](../../ZeissCondenser);  got [some advice](https://www.microbehunter.com/microscopy-forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=15701).  
Bought a Nikon swing-out condenser; not enough working distance for 3mm epi plate over the stage.  
[ELWD condenser](../ELWDcondenser/) arguably has too much working distance.
