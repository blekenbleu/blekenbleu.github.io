## Received 9 June 2022  
Despite being advertised as a Labophot,
the frame has its Nikon Optiphot plate.
Both plastic base pads are fine.
Those tend to be problematic on Optiphot 2...  

The lamphouse was thankfully intact, having been removed as requested.  
Bulb lights; filament shows clearly in the field lens;  
diffuser is evidently missing...

Condenser carrier and rack are intact and working, 
but neither coarse nor fine stage focus knobs work.  

Bizarrly, power connecton from 12V bulb to base uses 110VAC plug and receptical,  
although they seemingly match those on page 10 of [the Optiphot instruction manual](https://cmrf.research.uiowa.edu/sites/cmrf.research.uiowa.edu/files/nikon-optiphot-manual_0.pdf).  

Condenser carrier and rack are seemingly identical to those on the diaphot Optiphot 66,  
except that, unlike the 66, a stop prevents it running off the pinion.  
That carrier design strikes me as odd; an upper U is rigid to the rack,  
with a screw that could anchor condensers to it, but a lower spring-loaded ring  
with two adjusting screws that presumably might be to center condensers,  
if they were tight in that floating ring and not anchored in the U...??

Condenser and substage assemblies mount on a dovetail that, also unlike on the 66.  
is removable from the (broken) coarse focus rack.
