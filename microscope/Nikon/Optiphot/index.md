## Received 9 June 2022  
Despite being advertised as a Labophot,
the frame has its Nikon Optiphot plate.

The lamphouse was thankfully intact, having been removed as requested.  
Bulb lights; filament shows clearly in the field lens;  
diffuser is evidently missing...   
Condenser carrier and rack are intact and working, 
but neither coarse nor fine stage focus knobs work.  
Both plastic base pads are fine.

Bizarrly, power connecton from 12V bulb to base uses 110VAC plug and receptical,  
although they seemingly match those on page 10 of [the Optiphot instruction manual](https://cmrf.research.uiowa.edu/sites/cmrf.research.uiowa.edu/files/nikon-optiphot-manual_0.pdf).
