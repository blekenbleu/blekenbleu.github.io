<h2>Optiphot 66 diascopic conversions</h2>
<a href="../DIA-EPI_base/">The base</a> arrived 1 June 2022 with broken condenser carrier centering screw:<br>
<img src="broken.jpg"><br clear=all>
Seller has been contacted..<br>
AO condenser dovetail is too large for Optiphot fork.<br>
<br>
Optiphot-66 diascopic base is essentially that of a Labophot,<br>
lacking Kohler lamp filament alignment provisions;<br>
illumination diffuser is buried in the base,<br>
and bulb location in the lamp house is not adjustable.<br>
<br>
AC power is/was switched by potentiometer on the front.<br>
Diascopic wiring in the base was hacked,<br>
originally providing 6V out 2-prong side receptacle based on adjacent switch.<br>
Someone converted that side switch to instead turn AC on/off,<br>
disconnected the side receptacle, ran AC cord from another 6V transformer<br>
thru a hole drilled in the other side rear of the base,<br>
hacked into the neutral AC line for the base transformer<br>
and added a 4 pole double throw center off switch<br>
to select either the base or external transformer,<br>
running green wire ground and unfused AC hot from the right side rear<br>
to that left side added 4PDT switch and tranformer power cord.<br>
<br>
Fine focus shaft was broken off at one end.
Loosening coarse focus flanges from their threaded tubing is problematic;
thread locker is wanted to set slip clutch resistance.
Removing a condenser focus rack from its substage bracket
seemingly requires a special wrench to loosen a pinion bearing retainer.
<br>
6V wiring to 20W base lamp was also hacked...<br>
<br>
Cutout for 6V receptacle is approx 25x11.6mm;  perhaps for a small panel meter...<br>
<br>
<h2>Restored base wiring</h2>

An Optiphot-66 originally had wiring from its <b>DIA EPI</b> switch<br>
to adjacent receptacle for powering a (6V, 20W) EPI illuminator,<br>
which is useless without compatible cable connectors and illuminator.<br>
Wiring to that switch presumably was yellow and orange<br>
from lamp connections and red from the bridge rectifier.
<dl>
<dt><b>AC neutral:</b>
<dd>White from cord to binding post,<br>
 white from binding post to transformer primary  .
<dt><b>AC hot:</b>
<dd>Black from cord to binding post, black from binding post to fuse,<br>
 black from fuse to control switch,<br>
 black from control switch to transformer primary.
<dt><b>AC ground:</b>
<dd>Green from cord to chassis.
<dt><b>6 VAC:</b>
<dd>Red pair from transformer to bridge rectifier.
<dt><b>6 VDC+:</b>
<dd>Red from bridge rectifier to lamp connector.
<dt><b>6 VDC-:</b>
<dd>Blue from bridge rectifier to power transistor emitter.<br>
 Yellow from transistor collector to potentiometer;<br>
 red from transistor collector to yellow to lamp connector.
<dt><b>Intensity control:</b>
<dd>Brown from power transistor base to potentiometer.

This 6V system seeming could be relatively easily <a href="../Labophot/#LED">converted to LED</a>;<br>
a common-emitter transistor can be nearly constant current than constant voltage...<br>

<h3>base mechanical</h3>
The section of broken centering screw remaining in the condenser carrier was short,<br>
about 3mm or so.  After careful setup, that remaining segment was drilled out,  leaving threads intact.<br>
<img src="field.jpg"><br clear=all>
A centering screw and field lens were still needed.<br>

<h3>Optiphot 1</h3>
What was listed as a <a href="../Optiphot/">Labophot</a>
is actually an <a href="../Optiphot/#Recvd">Optiphot 1</a>.<br>
In addition to the Kohler illumination and both condenser centering screws,<br>
it has a more powerful (50W) lamp house and a stage that rotates (about 270 degrees) as well as translates.<br>
Swapping vertical illuminator's 12V bulb to 6V (LED) would enable powering by -66 6V supply;<br>
Optiphot 1, after fine focus repair, will be a more capable frame, except for stage size..<br>

<h2>6 July: discopic transplant</h2>
The 1 June diascopic base has been mostly disassembled for several weeks;<br>
the seller reneged on a replacement condenser carrier and offered no partial refund.<br>
<br>
Removing substage from its focus rack requires a long (8-inch) 3mm Allen bit.<br>
Recentering an arm on a base, for illumination alignment,<br>
seems more difficult than realigning a substage on its focus rack,<br>
since condenser carriers have centering screws.<br>
Condenser rack has an adjustable spring-loaded upper stop<br>
and a removable screw for its lower stop.<br>
Sadly, diascopic lamp centering flange differ: 3- vs 4-hole mount;<br>
the 4-hole diascopic base would need centering on the epi arm with good focus.<br>
<br>
Condenser dovetail was slack, tightened by loosening right dovetail clamp screws<br>
and nudging tighter by twisting a flat blade screwdriver.<br>
Substage assembly with condenser carrier was mechanically centered in the good fine focus neck,<br>
and that neck was mechanically centered on the diascopic base.<br>
One of 4 screws securing the Optiphot-66 stage to its substage<br>
was definitely non-standard, but was reused rather than further mess<br>
with corresponding threads in the stage.<br>

<h2>14 Sept 2022: arm transplant</h2></a>
Given that <a href="../DIA-EPI_base/">the 1 June purchase</a> was basically a bust,
and the main things wrong with <a href="../Optiphot66_DIC/">20 July DIC Optiphot 66</a> were:
<li>missing stage
<li>failed fine focus
<br>
... then swapping good arm from the original (March 2021) Optiphot 66<br>
onto unmolested DIC Optiphot 66 base consolidates best parts.
<li>4 screws and field lens bezel to remove base optics and electronics from casting;
<li>4 screws and long coiled focus spring to remove base casting from arm.
<br>
DIC Optiphot 66 base EPI power receptical has 4 prongs, compatible with (50W) vertical illuminators,<br>
instead of 2 prongs on 1 June base.<br>
