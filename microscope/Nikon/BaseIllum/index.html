<h3>Nikon Optiphot 66 Illumination</h3>
Based on the original Optiphot, diascopic illumination was 6V 20W,<br>
compared with 12V 100W for <a href="../VertIllum/index.html">Universal EPI Vertical Illuminator</a> and Optiphot 2.<br>
Nikon 6V and 12V illumination power connectors differed:<br>
<table><tr>
<td align=center>6V</td><td align=center>12V</td></tr><tr>
<td><img width=83% src="Nikon6V.jpg"></td>
<td><img width=100% src="Nikon12V.jpg"></td>
</tr></table>
6V would suffice for LED conversions, but we'll stick with <a href="../../pinspot/index.htm">RGBW pin spot</a> for LED illumination.
