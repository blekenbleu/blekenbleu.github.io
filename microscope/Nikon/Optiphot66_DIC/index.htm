**C182578 Nikon Trinocular Microscope, Vertical Illuminator, Condenser, Objectives**

*"Missing the stage and eyepieces; Z-Axis Focus is not engaged with adjustment dials."*  <br>

This Nikon Trinocular Microscope features a Vertical Illuminator Assembly, an LWD0.65 Condenser,  <br>
four Objectives (MPlan 5 DIC 0.1 210/0, BD Plan 10/0.25 210/0, BD Plan 20 DIC 0.4 210/0,  <br>
and BD Plan 40 DIC 0.65 210/0), as shown. &nbsp;It provides both "Dia" and "Epi" illumination.<br>

It does NOT includes a Stage or Eyepieces, as shown. &nbsp;I examined some objects under each of the objectives,<br>
and I was able to focus on images by moving the stage platform by hand, and holding it in place<br>
(it moves smoothly by hand, but if you let go of it, it starts sinking down),<br>
but the Z-Axis Focusing Assembly is not engaged to the adjustment knobs on each side of the microscope.<br>

However, this is the extent of my testing of this microscope, and it is being sold as-is.<br>

Approximate overall unpacked dimensions: 18"L x 12"W x 23"H.<br>

<h3>Ordered 20 July 2022</h3>
