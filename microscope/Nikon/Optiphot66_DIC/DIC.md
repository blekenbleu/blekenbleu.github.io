## [EPI DIC](https://www.microscopyu.com/techniques/dic/reflected-light-dic-microscopy)  
Optiphot EPI DIC is strictly brightfield; DIC sliders block coaxial illumination.

What you need to look out for is the polarizer and analyzer.  
The best option has a rotatable polarizer  
with a separate quarter wave plate slider,  
mostly meant for epi DIC but good without too.

Nikon Eclipse favored for De Senarmont system and long WD  
[De Senarmont Bias Retardation in DIC Microscopy](Bias Retardation in DIC Microscopy)  
wants 1/4 wavelength retardation plate fixed  
while polarizer can rotate +/- 45 degrees.

Look down an eye tube without eyepiece,  
you should see a white circle with a black stripe in the middle  
if DIC is properly aligned.

1st and 2nd use a single translating Nomarski prism above objectives;  
3rd [Senarmont type](https://www.manualslib.com/manual/1725578/Nikon-Optiphot-Pol.html?page=19) has dedicated prisms per objective.  

### [rogeliomoreno's diascopic DIC considerations](https://www.microbehunter.com/microscopy-forum/viewtopic.php?p=126130#p126130)  
1. The objective's prism and the condenser's prism must match.  
   I did try to use Nikon objective's prisms (made for the N2 condenser's prism) with M condenser's prism and they did not work.  
2. Condenser prims are made to be mounted at precise distance from the condenser's lens, close to focal point.  
3. Prisms have to be oriented 45 degrees from polarizer direction  
   (Polarizer is typically oriented left-right and analyzer back-front)  
   First, find objective prism's orientation:  
   remove both prisms from the light train,  
   and cross the polarizer and analyzer  
   (light through eyepieces is darkest),   
   now put the objective's prism in the light train,  
   remove an eyepieces and check for the black line:  
   -  it should be oriented at 45 degrees,  
   -  *note*: not all prisms show the black line when put between crossed polarizers  
      (the Nikon N1, N2 family of DIC prisms do not show that line, but mostly do).  
  Second, orient the condenser prism (the black line) in the same direction  
  (/ or \\) as the objective's prism,  
  remove the objective prism from the light train  
  and insert the condenser prism,  
  turn that prism until its black line aligns with the objective's.

A DIC prism matches an objective's rear focal plane
(which is usually inside the objective,  
so the DIC prism must be of the Nomarski type)

 &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nomarski*  
The front interference plane of an objective-side Nomarski prism  
must coincide with the objective's rear focal plane.  
The upper wedge must be thinner than the lower wedge in a Nomarski prism,  
but most drawings just have a straight line connecting the corners.  
Small but important difference.
