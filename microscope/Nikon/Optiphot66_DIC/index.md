**C182578 Nikon Trinocular Microscope, Vertical Illuminator, Condenser, Objectives**

*"Missing the stage and eyepieces; Z-Axis Focus is not engaged with adjustment dials."*    

This Nikon Trinocular Microscope features a Vertical Illuminator Assembly, an LWD0.65 Condenser,    
four Objectives (MPlan 5 DIC 0.1 210/0, BD Plan 10/0.25 210/0, BD Plan 20 DIC 0.4 210/0,    
and BD Plan 40 DIC 0.65 210/0), as shown.  

It provides both "Dia" and "Epi" illumination.  

It does NOT includes a Stage or Eyepieces, as shown.  

I examined some objects under each of the objectives, and I was able to focus on images    
by moving the stage platform by hand, and holding it in place (it moves smoothly by hand,    
but if you let go of it, it starts sinking down),    
but the Z-Axis Focusing Assembly is not engaged to the adjustment knobs on each side of the microscope.  

However, this is the extent of my testing of this microscope, and it is being sold as-is.  

Approximate overall unpacked dimensions: 18"L x 12"W x 23"H.

## Ordered 20 July 2022  
The same vendor (outback6) from whom I got a Type F trinocular head,  
so I am optimistic that EPI DIC may work...  
-----------------------------------------------------------  
30mm WF 10X / 23 eyepieces were ordered for the UW head
