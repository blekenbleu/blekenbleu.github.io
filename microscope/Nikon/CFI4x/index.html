Infinity objectives can be zoomed by mounting with a filter ring adapter<br>
on a telephoto zoom lens focused at infinity.<br>
<br>
"Instead, 
<a href="https://www.photomacrography.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=277496#p277496">for me the main advantages for infinity designs</a> are that<br>
I can more easily get the features I mentioned earlier (higher resolution, longer working distance, bigger image circles, better color correction),
plus I can alter the magnification by changing tube lens FL without adding aberrations.
On APS-C, the sharpest "5X" in my kit is an infinity 10X pushed down on 100 mm tube lens,<br>
and the sharpest "10X" is a 20X infinity pushed down in the same way."<br>
Focus bracketing works somewhat by

 It cleanly covers APS-C at 2.7X, used with a 135 mm tube lens.<br>
 So, I think it would have no trouble covering full frame at 4X."

For E Plans,
<a href="https://www.microscope.healthcare.nikon.com/products/optics/cfi-e-plan-achromat-series">Nikon says</a> "with virtually no curvature of field when the field number is 20 millimeters"<br>
while for the CFI Plan Achromat they say "incredible image flatness over the entire 25mm field of view".<br>

<a href="https://www.microscope.healthcare.nikon.com/about/news/nikon-introduces-the-eclipse-e100-infinity-corrected-educational-microscope">BE Plan Achromat objectives have been designed especially for the E100</a><br>
with excellent optical corrections and very flat (Plan) optical performance. (2006)<br>
<br>
"It's a safe bet that the E Plans are achromats because Nikon wouldn't sell any less<br>
 and if they were better they would say so."<br>

<h3>10 June 2022 received intact, carefully packed in a box partially crushed by UPS</h3>

Screwed to front of EF-S 55-250mm, presumably getting 1.1x - 5x zoom.<br>
Field of view is about 12mm at 55mm (with vignetting from 55-200) and 5mm at 250.<br>
