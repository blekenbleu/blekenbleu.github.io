## Optiphot 66 Phase Contrast-2 ELED 0.3 hack

The intent was to repurpose this ELWD condenser as a darkfield turret.  
[The turret](PhaseContrast/) arrived before the [lens](ELWDcondenser/index.html).  
Had I more carefully read that it was [for inverted Diaphots
only](https://lavinia.as.arizona.edu/~mtuell/scopes/condenser_list.php),  
I would have been better prepared for disappointment.  
The turret interferes with arched supports in 66 stage casting,  
and the condenser carrier probably does not lower enough for its lens.  
The condenser rack pinion cannot be removed from the substage casting  
without a special tool to engage 4 notches in the pinion bearing retainer.  
Unlike the condensor rack, the substage rack seemingly cannot be removed,  
even after removing the stop screw,  
by simply continuing to raise or lower the coarse focus.  

Unlike other Optiphots, the fine focus gear appears to be metal,
rather than plastic,  
or perhaps was replaced by a previous owner.    
While it also comes loose from its shaft,
it seems less likely to break.  

It is easier to swap the EPI's unbroken focus into the diaphot's arm  
than to move the condenser rack and pinion to the EPI arm.
