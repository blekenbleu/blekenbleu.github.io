<h2>Nikon Labophot Microscope</h2>
Introduced around the same time as the Optiphot (1978), the Labophot is lower cost and less flexible.<br>
Positioned for labs rather than research, many were configured for phase contrast.

<h2>LED conversion</h2></a>
Common (grounded) emitter bipolar transistors are approximately constant current sources.<br>
Labophot and Optiphot use transistors to modulate halogen lamp power<br>
and variable resistors between base and collector for control.<br>
Labophot potentiometers are about 1K Ohms, connected between collector and base,<br>
with halogen lamp between collector and nominal +7 VDC,<br>
to accommodate incandescent lamp behavior:<ul compact>
<li> As filament heats, resistance increases.
<li> This lowers voltage drop from collector to emitter<br>
  and also current thru resistor to base, reducing power to lamps.
<li>20W halogen lamps start dimly illuminating with nearly 1A current,<br>
which may be LED maximum.<br>
<img src="plot.png"><br clear=all>
Currents were measured using a CA-60 AC/DC clamp.<br>
<img src="VI.jpg">
</ul>
<br>
LEDs behave differently:<ul compact>
<li> For the (2N3716) transistor to work as a nearly constant current source,<br>
  reconfigure variable resistor as a voltage divider between +/-Vcc<br>
  with wiper to base, causing negative feedback<br>
  as base-to-emitter voltage increases with current.
<li> Selected LED should be bright enough with 1A<br> that 0.65V is maximum base Voltage;<br>
   680 Ohms above 1K potentiometer should sufficiently limit current;<br>
  need to determine minimum base drive for useful brightness.<br>
  to establish resistance between 1K potentiometer and ground.
<li>LED will drop nearly constant 6V; transistor will dissipate < 1W.   
<li> Above some voltage threshold, current increases with temperature.
<li> this effectively decreases resistance<br>
  increasing transistor collector-emitter voltage and current<br>
  thru collector-base resistance, provoking current runaway.
<li> Supply Voltage Vcc droops slightly with increased current,<br>
  providing slight stabilizing negative feedback.

<br>
To power a 5W LED instead of 20W halogen,<br>
replace 1K variable resistor between 2N3716 collector and base,<br>
which supplies a minimum of 1mA forward bias,<br>

<a name="FineFocus"><h3>Fine Focus</h3></a>
This "parts only" Labophot was 1 of only 2 Nikon finite CF microscope frames received with intact fine focus;<br>
broken focus on 2 others had split polymer pinion gears; &nbsp
another lost its grip on the shaft flat, for which symptions are:<ul compact>
<li>turning fine focus knobs having no effect
<li>turning coarse focus knobs having no or inconsistent effect
<li>stage settling <i>without knob motion</i>
<li>turning coarse focus knob when stage is at a limit NOT provoking fine focus knob spin</ul>
To understand how Labophot/Optiphot stage focus works, first consider a planetary gear set:<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_and_planet_gear"><img align=left src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Meccano_Sun_%26_planet_animation.gif"></a>
 .. and that if <i>either</i> sun or planet gear were <i>not</i> fixed,<br> &nbsp
 then torque could not be transmitted.<br><br> &nbsp
While a polymer gear might be damaged by exceedingly stiff focus rack<br> &nbsp
 e.g. from dried grease, IMO damage more likely occurs<br> &nbsp
when a user twists fine focus while focus rack is against a stop<br> &nbsp or coarse focus is held by the other hand.<br clear=all>
<br>
Labophot/Optiphot focus functioning involves<ul compact>
<li>a fine focus shaft(111), inside
<li>a coarse focus tube(110) to which knob(104) and brass gearcase(107) fasten, inside
<li>a pinion gear tube(109) with sun gear(123), driving
<li>a stage focus rack(9), where
<li>focus shaft and coaxial tubes are connected by sun and planet gears(123-128).
<li>The fine focus shaft wave (spring) washer and grease apply resistance to coarse knobs via delrin washers.
<li>If/when a fine focus pinion (sun) gear(128) splits or otherwise loses grip on its shaft,<br>then the focus (planetary) gear train cannot transmit torque.</ul>
