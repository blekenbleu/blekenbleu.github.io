<h2>Nikon Labophot Microscope</h2>
Introduced around the same time as the Optiphot (1978), the Labophot is lower cost and less flexible.<br>
Positioned for labs rather than research, many were configured for phase contrast.

<h2>LED conversion</h2>
Common (grounded) emitter bipolar transistors are approximately constant current sources.<br>
Labophot and Optiphot use transistors to modulate halogen lamp power<br>
and variable resistors between base and collector for control.<br>
Labophot potentiometers are about 1K Ohms, connected between collector and base,<br>
with halogen lamp between collector and nominal +7 VDC,<br>
to accommodate incandescent lamp behavior:<ul compact>
<li> As filament heats, resistance increases.
<li> This lowers voltage drop from collector to emitter<br>
  and also current thru resistor to base, reducing power to lamps.
<img src="plot.png"><br clear=all>
Current was measured using a CA-60 AC/DC clamp.<br>
</ul>
<br>
LEDs behave differently:<ul compact>
<li> Selected LED should be bright enough with 1A<br> that 1K is minimum resistance wanted from supply to base;<br>
  need to determine a minimum current for useful brightness<br>
  to establish wanted potentiometer range.
<li> Above some voltage threshold, current increases with temperature.
<li> this effectively decreased resistance<br>
  increases transistor collector-emitter voltage and current<br>
  thru collector-base resistance, provoking current runaway.
<li> Supply Voltage Vcc droops slightly with increased current,<br>
  providing slight stabilizing negative feedback.
<li> For the transistor to behave as a more nearly constant current source,<br>
  replace variable resistor with potentiometer between Vcc and ground<br>
  with wiper to base, increasing negative feedback,<br>
  as base-to-emitter voltage increases with current.
<li> Potentiometer in series with forward-biased diode to ground<br>
  (nearly constant voltage drop)<br>
  could strengthen current regulation.<br>
