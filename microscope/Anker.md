*20W USB-C 10,000mAh AC charger and portable power bank*  

This will be used:  
* to power macro lens LED light portably  
* to power cameras attached to microscopes  

That push button on the side has 8 tinly LEDs to show status;  
they are visible only when viewed nearly squarely,  
so NOT looking down at an angle when it is plugged in an outlet low on walls.

To work with a (Canon M6 II) dummy battery:   
* first insert dummy battery into the camera,  
* connect the dummy battery to this Anker power bank,  
* turn on the camera,  
* THEN plug Anker into AC.  
* Otherwise (turning on camera *after* pluggin Anker into AC),  
  Anker defaults to recharge mode and does NOT supply power to the camera.  

Press the button twice to set trickle charge mode - green dot lights.  
Press twice again to disable trickle charge mode.  

USB-C port is output only;  charging is only by AC.  
AC charging rate is 16 Watts.  
A device can be charging at up to 4 Watts while the bank is plugged in,  
while still charging the bank at 16watts.  
A device pulling more than 4 Watts disables bank recharging.  
USB A port device is prioritized over USB-C;  
Cmbined power exceeding 20 Watts disables the USB C.  
USB-C port alone max is 9V 2A;  limit with both ports is 5V.
