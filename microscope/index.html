Stylus image capture employs a 10x epi microscope objective with darkfield illumination and Olympus NFK 3.3x projection ocular into a Canon DSLR.<br>
To hold the stylus at ~45 degrees, the cartridge was mounted in a headshell
with no finger lift and clamped at the bayonet connector using a clothespin:

A bellows is not necessary; &nbsp extension tubes suffice, with more length yielding greater magnification.<br>
The resulting image has decent resolution, but poor contrast.<br>

This microscope has short working distance objectives; &nbsp
the 20x objective would not clear this stylus' plastic grip at this angle.<br>
90 degree shots will clear but require image stacking; &nbsp
whether objective darkfield illumination will then
highlight stylus wear spots remains to be seen.<br>
<br>
Using a camera with zoomed Live View eases focusing.<br>
Silent shutter (Canon's mode 2) and remote shutter release minimize vibration during exposures.<br>
Replacing halogen illumination with blue LEDs may improve image resolution.<br>
<br>
Canon DSLRs with Live View and silent shutter (e.g. 40D) can be had used for less than $100.<br>
Monocular microscope heads typically cost much less than trinoculars,<br>
and used eyetube camera adapter clamps go for around $15.<br>
Eyetube adapters typically have T2 threads, requiring an additional camera-to-T2 adapter.<br>
A projection ocular and extension tubes should cost less than $100;<br>
the trick is obtaining a more or less complete microscope with epi illumination and bright/darkfield objectives.<br>
Starting from scratch, I would look for Nikon 210mm B/D objectives...<br>
<br>
To investigate contrast, <a href="https://www.vinylengine.com/turntable_forum/viewtopic.php?p=1034041#p1034041">Ray Parkhurst</a> suggested 
removing the camera and looking down into the tube.<br>
Internal surfaces were not reflecting appreciable light,
but a small bright spot and dim blob were seen in the optic at the bottom of the eyetube.<br>
Lacking a ground glass, I laid wax paper over the camera adapter:<br>

The dim blob is revealed as the projected stylus.<br>
The bright spot appears less focused than when viewed directly and, depending on viewing angle,
more or less distinct from the projected stylus image.<br>

Completely removing the microscope head and looking down into the body<br>
reveals a bright spot centered in an epi illuminator lens<br>
as well as a less bright spot on the lower lip of that port.<br>

I suppose that bright spot provokes flare in the tube lens of the removed head.<br>
An A.O. #3002 image erector spaced the head further from the epi illuminator<br>
and slightly improved contrast, despite adding more optics in the path:<br>
