<h3>Microscope Stylus Images</h3>
<h3>Background</h3>
Photomicrography and macro photography are both popular subjects in the InterWeb,<br>
including among better writers than I.&nbsp  Consequently, content here will focus (heh) on specific experiences,<br>
rather than more general theory and technique,
which for macro photography see e.g. <a href="https://www.allanwallsphotography.com/blog/zereneorheliconpt1">Allan Walls</a>.<br><br>
Years ago, I saw and admired <a href="https://www.micrographia.com/projec/projapps/viny/viny0300.htm">Micrographia</a>
and more recently <a href="https://www.vinylengine.com/turntable_forum/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=92996">Ray Parkhurst</a>'s <a href="http://www.photomacrography.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=44329">work</a><br>
 including contributions to vinylengine.com <a href="https://www.vinylengine.com/turntable_forum/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=112532">Stylus images on the not cheap (but not massively expensive)</a>.<br>
Capturing images of phonograph needles combines 3 of my long-time interests:<br>
audio, photography, and microscopy, although mostly microscopes with cameras.<br><br>

While not aspiring to create aesthetically pleasing images,<br>
facilitating capture of clear and useful phono stylus image wear images seems achievable.<br>
 Ray demonstrated that <a href="Nikon/">Nikon</a>'s <a href="https://krebsmicro.com/mplan.pdf">long working distance <a href=Nikon/Metaphot/#CF"><b>CF</b></a> objectives</a> are well-suited to this,<br>
while I already owned American Optical (AO) microscopes lacking long working distance objectives, oh well.<br>

<h3>Generalities</h3>
Microscopes traditionally shared some mechanical conventions:
<ul compact>
<li>RMS (Royal Microscope Society) Objective threads
<li>23.2 o.d. eyepiece (ocular) tubes
<li>160mm "tube length"
</ul>
Consequently, optically-matched objectives and oculars could be swapped among frames.<br>
Practically, after frames evolved from straight tubes to separate heads with prisms,<br>
additional lenses might be introduced, specifically to allow for e.g. vertical illuminators<br>
and/or polarizing filters to be inserted into optical paths.<br>
These optics are typically optimized for some manufacturer's objectives optical formula.<br>
Most modern microscopes use other than RMS threads; <a href="http://www.photomacrography.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=11710">here is a list</a>.<br>
<a href="https://agenaastro.com/articles/guides/astronomy-threads-explained.html">Here is a list of threads used in astronomy</a>.<br>

<a name="combo"><h3>Camera + Microscope Combinations</h3></a>
<ul compact>
<li>illumination: internal vs external; brightfield vs darkfield
<li>camera optics: direct (from finite objective) focus vs relay (projection) vs afocal
<li>camera attachments: direct to objective vs direct to arm (without head) vs eyepiece clamp vs trinocular tube
<li>microscope illumination: diascopic (AO Series 10) vs episcopic (EPIStar).

<li><a href="https://www.photomacrography.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=12147">FAQ: How can I hook a microscope objective to my camera?</a> - rjlittlefield 
</ul>

<a href="https://www.prc68.com/I/MicroPhotography.html">Brooke Clarke</a> also addressed <a href="https://www.prc68.com/I/MicroPhotography.html#Microscope_Lens_on_Camera">these combinations</a>.<br><br>
Attaching microscope objectives directly to cameras is considered macro photography,<br>
rather than photomicroscopy, and will mostly be addressed elsewhere.<br>
However, attaching a camera body to a microscope body<br>
with nothing but air between objective and sensor
is generally considered photomicroscopy.<br>
This works with so-called finite objectives.<br>
Infinity objectives want a so-called tube lens to make rays finite,<br>
either for oculars or directly focusing on a sensor, in which case<br>
that tube lens may be a telescopic camera lens focused at infinity.<br>
Since some infinity microscopes depend on their tube lens
to correct objective aberrations,<br>
direct projection from microsope's tube lens
to camera's sensor may yield better images.<br>
AO pioneered infinity microscope production in the U.S.; &nbsp;
<a href="https://www.microbehunter.com/microscopy-forum/viewtopic.php?t=14662">read here for more history</a><br>
Practically, for optical magnifications much more than 1x,<br>
technique and patience exceeding mine are wanted for hand-held macrophotography.<br>
For inanimate as well as opaque subjects, hand-holding has few advantages.<br>
<br>
Opaque object microscopy requires reflective, rather than transmissive, illumination.<br>
This is called <i>episcopic</i> (contrasted to <i>diascopic</i>) with illumination accomplished either by<br>
external illumination sources or using so-called vertical illumination built into microscopes,<br>
where light may be directed down thru objectives, e.g. using prisms or other partial mirrors<br>
and called brightfield, or coaxially around objectives, called darkfield illumination.<br>
<br>
Most conventional (diascopic biological) microscopes can be used with external illumination<br>
for some opaque microscopy, but their objectives are optimized for viewing thru glass slide covers,<br>
which becomes increasingly important for higher magnification objectives, e.g. more than 10-20x.<br>
<br>
<h3>Live View, focus bracketing, Abbe</h3>
Using a digital camera with zoomed Live View eases focusing.<br>
Beyond convenience, best viewfinder focus with DSLR mirror down may differ from best focus on the sensor.<br>
Silent shutter (Canon's mode 2) and <a href="RS60E3.htm">remote shutter release</a> minimize vibration during exposures.<br>
Replacing halogen illumination with blue LEDs should improve image resolution,<br>
since the Abbe diffraction limit depends on illumination wavelength and Numerical Aperture (NA).<br>
Practically, blue LEDs not only have shorter wavelengths than do red and green
<br>but excluding those longer wavelengths also usefully reduces chromatic artifacts from older and simpler lenses.
<br>
Canon DSLRs with Live View and silent shutter (e.g. 50D) can be had used for less than $100.<br>
Even better, <a href="https://builds.magiclantern.fm/"><b>free Magic Lantern firmware</b></a> adds

<a name=EYECLAMP><h2>Eye tube camera adapter clamps</h2></a>
<a name=M25>Traditional eyepiece tubes have about 25mm o.d.,
for which T-mount adapters were made.</a>
Common brands were Kalt, Aetna and Telestar,
but many identical or similar clamps were branded for cameras.<br>

Eyetube adapters typically have T2 or M42 threads,
requiring a camera-specific adapter.<br>
A projection ocular and extension tubes should cost less than $100;<br>
monocular microscope heads typically cost much less than trinoculars,<br>
while having less light loss than binocular heads,<br>
and used eye tube camera adapter clamps go for around $15.<br>
obtaining a more or less complete used microscope
with epi illumination and bright/darkfield objectives can be tricky.<br>

<a name=EPIStar><h3>baby steps with EPIStar</h3></a>
Initial stylus image capture employs a 10x epi microscope objective with darkfield illumination and Olympus NFK 3.3x projection ocular into a Canon EOS sensor.<br>
To hold the stylus at ~45 degrees, the cartridge was mounted in a headshell
with no finger lift and clamped at the bayonet connector using a clothespin:
<table border="0"><tr><td>
<img src="Images/HeadshellClothespin.jpg">
</td><td>
<img src="Images/EPIStar6D.jpg">
</td</tr></table><br>
Although it facilitates sorting spacing between camera sensor and objectives, a bellows is not necessary;<br>
 extension tubes suffice, with more length yielding greater magnification.<br>
The resulting image has decent resolution, but poor contrast.<br>
<img src="Images/EPI10xM55E.jpg">
<br clear=all>
This microscope has short working distance objectives; <br>
the 20x objective would not clear this stylus' plastic grip at this angle.<br>
90 degree shots will clear but require image stacking; <br>
whether objective darkfield illumination will then
highlight stylus wear spots remains to be seen.<br>

<a name="EPICONTRAST"><h3>EPIStar contrast</h3></a>
To investigate low contrast, <a href="https://www.vinylengine.com/turntable_forum/viewtopic.php?p=1034041#p1034041">Ray Parkhurst</a> suggested 
removing the camera and looking down into the tube.<br>

Internal surfaces were not reflecting appreciable light,<br>
but a small bright spot and dim blob are seen in the optic at the bottom of the eye tube.<br><br>

The dim blob is revealed as the projected stylus.<br>
The bright spot appears less focused than when viewed directly and,<br>
 depending on viewing angle,
more or less distinct from the projected stylus image.<br><br>
<table><tr><td>
Removing the microscope head and looking down into the arm<br>
reveals a bright spot centered in an epi illuminator lens<br>
in a port off to one side<br>
as well as a less bright spot on the lower lip of that port.<br>
That <i>very</i> bright area below the epi lens is the brightfield mirror.

<a name=AO10NFK><h4>A.O. 10X with NFK 3.3X</h4></a>
With an AO head, AO objectives are substantially corrected, better matching a Nikon CF PL relay lens.<br>
Headless, an NFK relay lens approximates AO tube lens corrections.<br>
Finding the stylus with a microscope objective is easier using conventional oculars<br>
 than with camera Live View and relay lens.<br>
Since the head has an infinity tube lens, this requires infinity objectives.<br>
Since Series 10 AO Spencers often include a 10X objective, how well does one work on a stylus?<br>
Because they are smaller in diameter than MEIJI and Leitz objectives<br>
for which cardstock half-cylinders were epoxied to LED halos, a shim was cut from clear vinyl tubing.<br>
<img src="Images/AO10Xshim.jpg"><br clear=all>
This particular objective appears to have about 4mm working distance.<br>
With halo illumination, stylus tip is better illuminated with cartridge vertical centerline<br>
rotated more nearly 60 than 45 degrees from horizontal, reducing stylus surface in focus.
<p>
With NFK 3.3X relay lens and about 200mm projection distance,<br>
full field of view with APS-C sensor is usefully in focus;<br>
both of these images (downsampled, but not cropped) were captured after central focusing (zoomed Live View):<br>
