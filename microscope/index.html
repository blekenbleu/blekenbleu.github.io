Stylus image capture employs a 10x epi microscope objective with darkfield illumination and Olympus NFK 3.3x projection ocular into a Canon DSLR.<br>
To hold the stylus at ~45 degrees, the cartridge was mounted in a headshell
with no finger lift and clamped at the bayonet connector using a clothespin:

A bellows is not necessary; &nbsp extension tubes suffice, with more length yielding greater magnification.<br>
The resulting image has decent resolution, but poor contrast.<br>

This microscope has short working distance objectives; &nbsp
the 20x objective would not clear this stylus' plastic grip at this angle.<br>
90 degree shots will clear but require image stacking; &nbsp
whether objective darkfield illumination will then
highlight stylus wear spots remains to be seen.<br>
<br>
Using a camera with zoomed Live View eases focusing.<br>
Silent shutter (Canon's mode 2) and remote shutter release minimize vibration during exposures.<br>
Replacing halogen illumination with blue LEDs may improve image resolution.<br>
<br>
Canon DSLRs with Live View and silent shutter (e.g. 40D) can be had used for less than $100.<br>
Monocular microscope heads typically cost much less than trinoculars,<br>
and used eyetube camera adapter clamps go for around $15.<br>
Eyetube adapters typically have T2 threads, requiring an additional camera-to-T2 adapter.<br>
A projection ocular and extension tubes should cost less than $100;<br>
the trick is obtaining a more or less complete microscope with epi illumination and bright/darkfield objectives.<br>
Starting from scratch, I would look for Nikon 210mm B/D objectives...<br>
<br>
To investigate contrast, <a href="https://www.vinylengine.com/turntable_forum/viewtopic.php?p=1034041#p1034041">Ray Parkhurst</a> suggested 
removing the camera and looking down into the tube.<br>
Internal surfaces were not reflecting appreciable light,
but a small bright spot and dim blob were seen in the optic at the bottom of the eyetube.<br>
Lacking a ground glass, I laid wax paper over the camera adapter:<br>
<table border="0"><tr><td>
<img src="WaxProjection.jpg"
</td><td>
<img src="FlareProjection.jpg">
</td><td>
<img src="WaxFlare.jpg">
</td</tr></table>
The dim blob is revealed as the projected stylus.<br>
The bright spot appears less focused than when viewed directly and, depending on viewing angle,
more or less distinct from the projected stylus image.<br>
<p align=center>
Completely removing the microscope head and looking down into the body<br>
reveals a bright spot centered in an epi illuminator lens<br>
as well as a less bright spot on the lower lip of that port.<br>
<img src="EpiSpot.jpg" align=center><br clear=all>
I suppose that bright spot provokes flare in the tube lens of the removed head.<br>
An A.O. #3002 image erector spaced the head further from the epi illuminator<br>
and slightly improved contrast, despite adding more optics in the path:<br>

Microscopes better resolve by blue illumination, since shorter wavelength
and less opportunity for chromatic aberrations.<br>
A <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FWX19QS">40mm RGB LED halo ring</a> fits around microscope objectives and can be supported by a 20mm i.d. o-ring.
<br> <img src="
BlueRing.jpg
"> <br clear=all>
<br>Since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_filter">Bayer-filtered camera sensors</a> have relatively sparse blue pixels,<br> aliasing is liable for images with less than 4x oversampling.<br> <img src="
BlueM55E.jpg
"> <br clear=all>
The dark wedge along the center of the above blue M55E stylus image turns out to be surface not in focus.<br>
That o-ring below LED halo blocks some illumination; 
<br>the next revision glued
a curled strip of business card as a half-cylinder to the halo backside...
<p align=center> ...allowing an o-ring to secure LEDs on the objective from above:<br>
<img src="

Rotating the headshell in the clothespin to bring more of the stylus upper surface more nearly in focus <br> and using green light instead of blue to involve more camera pixels yields the following:<br>

Contrast could be improved by putting something flat black between the cantilever and its light plastic grip.

Increased spacing between objective and focal plane<br>
in theory <a href="http://www.science-info.net/docs/etc/Tube-Length-na.gif">impacts numerical aperture</a>,<br>
but trials with bellows did not indicate any drastic effects,<br>
with results compromised by difficulty focusing.<br>
Eliminating all optics but objective should have increased contrast,<br>
but illumination differences and reduction in magnification confound comparison.

Here is a 1:1 crop of that stylus tip from an APS-C Canon sensor:<br>

With camera body attached to a microscope, zoomed live view eases focusing,<br>
but using objectives with bellows mostly demonstrated<br>
limitations of conventional photography focus rails.<br>
Resolution in this setup may also be constrained by sensor pixel density..<br>

 50.5mm dovetail to M42 adapter arrived from
 
 <a href="https://rafcamera.com/microscope-dovetail-adapter-50-4mm-to-m42x1">RAF Camera</a>.<br>

 This secures camera body and extender tubes to A.O. arm without head (and tube lens).<br>
Finite objectives can then be used in A.O. arm with much better positioning and focus control than by bellows.

10X is not nearly enough to fill APS-C sensor with stylus:<br>

Making this image was much easier than with bellows,
except for positioning the LED to approximately match illumination.

Zooming the Leitz image
<br>(right-click, "Open image in new tab", then [Ctrl]&amp[+] keys)<br>
reveals that only about the center third is nearly focussed;
<br>this objective wants to be used with a 3.3X relay lens..
<a name=LEITZNFK><h4>Leitz 10X with NFK 3.3X</h4></a>
Repurposing available bellows, EF and T2 extension tubes with adapters<br>
yields nearly 140mm parfocal distance for Leitz objective to NFK 3.3X relay lens<br>
and 150mm projection distance to APS-C sensor.<br><br>
NFK 3.3X is perched at the T2-EF adapter:<br>
<img src="Leitz3.3Xstack.jpg"><br clear=all>
This stack is decidedly less than rigid<br>
and <i>really</i> needs electronic shutter and remote release.<br><br>

NFK 3.3X corrections designed for Olympus objectives cause
chromatic focus differences from Leitz 10X alone.<br><br>
With 40mm RGB LED halo on Leitz objective,
M55E stylus is better illuminated.<br>
Additional 3.3X magnification allows use of blue LED for better optical resolution followed by about 4x downsampling after converting blue to grayscale and adjusting dynamic range:<br>

The stylus in the above image was rotated less than 45 degrees from horizontal.<br>
This image has the stylus rotated somewhat more than 45 degrees,<br>
illuminated by white (R+G+B)LED halo, no contrast adjustment:<br>

<a name=AO10NFK><h4>A.O. 10X with NFK 3.3X</h4></a>
Finding the stylus with a microscope objective is easier using conventional oculars<br>
 than with camera Live View and projection ocular.<br>
Since the head has an infinity tube lens, this requires infinity objectives.<br>
Since Series 10 AO Spencers often include a 10X objective, how well does one work on a stylus?<br>
Because they are smaller in diameter than MEIJI and Leitz objectives<br>
for which cardstock half-cylinders were epoxied to LED halos, a shim was cut from clear vinyl tubing.<br>
<img src="AO10Xshim.jpg"><br clear=all>
This particular objective appears to have about 4mm working distance.<br>
With halo illumination, stylus tip is better illuminated with cartridge vertical centerline<br>
rotated more nearly 60 than 45 degrees from horizontal, reducing stylus surface in focus.
<p>
With NFK 3.3X relay lens and about 200mm projection distance,<br>
full field of view with APS-C sensor is usefully in focus;<br>
both of these images (downsampled, but not cropped) were captured after central focusing (zoomed Live View):<br>

After visually confirming that minimal detail is lost by downsampling original (5472x3648) images by 3x,<br>
then, given optics are NOT matched for color correction,<br>
compared whether blue (left) or green (right) illumination yields more detail:<br>

<img align=right src="EPIStar55-250STM.jpg">
Infinity objectives can be used with a camera lens focussed @ infinity,<br>
in this case, a Reichert EPIStar 10x with Canon EF-S 55-250mm STM zoomed to 250mm.<br>
To prevent this zoom from collapsing to 55mm, the camera body needs support.<br>
Fortunately, focus is internal.
