<h3><a href="stacking">focus stacking</a></h3>
<h3>background</h3>
Photomicrography and macro photography are both popular subjects in the InterWeb,<br>
including among better writers than I.&nbsp  Consequently, content here will focus (heh) on specific experiences,<br>
rather than more general theory and technique,
for which see e.g. <a href="https://www.allanwallsphotography.com/blog/zereneorheliconpt1">Allan Walls</a>.<br><br>
Years ago, I saw and admired <a href="http://www.micrographia.com/projec/projapps/viny/viny0300.htm">Micrographia</a>
and more recently <a href="https://www.vinylengine.com/turntable_forum/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=92996">Ray Parkhust's work</a><br>
 including contributions to vinylengine.com <a href="https://www.vinylengine.com/turntable_forum/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=112532">Stylus images on the not cheap (but not massively expensive)</a>.<br>

While not aspiring to create aesthetically pleasing images,<br>
facilitating capture of clear and useful phono stylus image wear images seems achievable.<br>
 Ray demonstrated that Nikon's long working distance CF objectives are well-suited to this,<br>
while I already owned American Optical (AO) microscopes lacking color correction and long working distance objectives, oh well.<br>
<br>
Initial stylus image capture employs a 10x epi microscope objective with darkfield illumination and Olympus NFK 3.3x projection ocular into a Canon DSLR.<br>
To hold the stylus at ~45 degrees, the cartridge was mounted in a headshell
with no finger lift and clamped at the bayonet connector using a clothespin:
<table border="0"><tr><td>
<img src="HeadshellClothespin.jpg">
</td><td>
<img src="EPIStar6D.jpg">
</td</tr></table><br>
Although it facilitates sorting spacing between camera sensor and objectives, a bellows is not necessary;<br>
 extension tubes suffice, with more length yielding greater magnification.<br>
The resulting image has decent resolution, but poor contrast.<br>
<img src="EPI10xM55E.jpg">
<br clear=all>
This microscope has short working distance objectives; <br>
the 20x objective would not clear this stylus' plastic grip at this angle.<br>
90 degree shots will clear but require image stacking; <br>
whether objective darkfield illumination will then
highlight stylus wear spots remains to be seen.<br>
<br>
Using a camera with zoomed Live View eases focusing.<br>
Beyond convenience, best focus with DSLR mirror down may differ from best focus on the sensor.<br>
Silent shutter (Canon's mode 2) and remote shutter release minimize vibration during exposures.<br>
Replacing halogen illumination with blue LEDs should improve image resolution,<br>
since the Abbe diffraction limit depends on illumination wavelength and Numerical Aperture (NA).<br>
Practically, blue LEDs not only have shorter wavelengths than do red and green
<br>but excluding those longer wavelengths also usefully reduces chromatic artifacts from older and simpler lenses.
<br>
Canon DSLRs with Live View and silent shutter (e.g. 50D) can be had used for less than $100.<br>
Even better, <a href="https://builds.magiclantern.fm/">free Magic Lantern software</a> adds
<https://builds.magiclantern.fm/features.html>focus stacking for many such cameras</a>.<br>
Monocular microscope heads typically cost much less than trinoculars,<br>
and used eyetube camera adapter clamps go for around $15.<br>
Common brands were Kalt, Aetna and Telestar, but many identical or similar clamps were branded for cameras.<br>
<img width=860 src="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/d~EAAOSw~yFiTHKx/s-l1600.jpg"><br clear=al>
Eyetube adapters typically have T2 threads, requiring an additional camera-to-T2 adapter.<br>
A projection ocular and extension tubes should cost less than $100;<br>
the trick is obtaining a more or less complete microscope with epi illumination and bright/darkfield objectives.<br>
Starting from scratch, I would look for Nikon 210mm B/D objectives...<br>
<br>
<a name="EPICONTRAST"><h3>EPIStar contrast</h3></a>
To investigate contrast, <a href="https://www.vinylengine.com/turntable_forum/viewtopic.php?p=1034041#p1034041">Ray Parkhurst</a> suggested 
removing the camera and looking down into the tube.<br>
<img src="EyetubeSpot.jpg" align=center> <br clear=all>
Internal surfaces were not reflecting appreciable light,<br>
but a small bright spot and dim blob are seen in the optic at the bottom of the eyetube.<br>
Lacking ground glass, wax paper was laid over the camera adapter:<br>
<table border="0"><tr><td>
<img src="WaxProjection.jpg"
</td><td>
<img src="FlareProjection.jpg">
</td></tr><tr><td>
<img src="WaxFlare.jpg">
</td</tr></table>
The dim blob is revealed as the projected stylus.<br>
The bright spot appears less focused than when viewed directly and,<br>
 depending on viewing angle,
more or less distinct from the projected stylus image.<br><br>
<table><tr><td>
Removing the microscope head and looking down into the arm<br>
reveals a bright spot centered in an epi illuminator lens<br>
in a port off to one side<br>
as well as a less bright spot on the lower lip of that port.<br>
That <i>very</i> bright area below the epi lens is the brightfield mirror.
</td><td>
<img src="EpiSpot.jpg" align=center></td></tr>
</table><br clear=all>
An A.O. #3002 image erector spaces the head further from the epi illuminator<br>
and slightly improved contrast, despite adding magnifying optics in the path:<br>

Microscopes better resolve by blue illumination, since shorter wavelength
and less opportunity for chromatic aberrations.<br>
A <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FWX19QS">40mm RGB LED halo ring</a> fits around microscope objectives and can be supported by a 20mm i.d. o-ring.
<br> <img src="
BlueRing.jpg
"> <br clear=all>
That o-ring below LED halo blocks some illumination... <br>
<br>Since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_filter">Bayer-filtered camera sensors</a> have relatively sparse blue pixels,<br> aliasing is liable for images with less than 4x oversampling.<br> <img src="
BlueM55E.jpg
"> <br clear=all>
The dark wedge along the center of the above blue M55E stylus image is partly surface not in focus,<br>
but also stylus angle not 45 degrees (twisted cantilever).<br>
<p>
The next revision glued
a curled strip of business card as a half-cylinder to the halo backside...<br>
 ...allowing an o-ring to secure LEDs on the objective from above:<br>
<img src="mk2green.jpg"> <br clear=all></p>
Rotating the headshell in the clothespin to bring more of the stylus upper surface more nearly in focus <br> and using green light instead of blue to involve more camera pixels yields the following:<br>
<img src="

"> <br clear=all><br>
Contrast could be improved by putting something flat black between the cantilever and its light plastic grip.

A set of infinity objectives acquired years ago<br>
also included a LEITZ WETZLAR 160/- EF 10/0.25<br>
with 6.8 mm working distance <a href="http://science-info.net/docs/leitz/LeitzLaborluxK-D-Brochure.pdf">(Laborlux K-D brochure page 14)</a><br>
A recently acquired RMS to T2 adapter enables macrophotography experiments.<br>

the RGB LED ring light mounting sleeve failed during an extended session;<br>
illumination temporarily reverted to white LED gooseneck while epoxy cures.

Increased spacing between objective and focal plane<br>
in theory <a href="http://www.science-info.net/docs/etc/Tube-Length-na.gif">impacts numerical aperture</a>,<br>
but trials with bellows did not indicate any drastic effects,<br>
with results compromised by difficulty focusing.<br>
Eliminating all optics but objective should have increased contrast,<br>
but illumination differences and reduction in magnification confound comparison.

Here is a 1:1 crop of that stylus tip from an APS-C Canon sensor:<br>

With camera body attached to a microscope, zoomed live view eases focusing,<br>
but using objectives with bellows mostly demonstrated<br>
limitations of conventional photography focus rails.<br>
Resolution in this setup may also be constrained by sensor pixel density..<br>

 50.5mm dovetail to M42 adapter arrived from
 
 <a href="https://rafcamera.com/microscope-dovetail-adapter-50-4mm-to-m42x1">RAF Camera</a>.<br>

 This secures camera body and extender tubes to A.O. arm without head (and tube lens).<br>
Finite objectives can then be used in A.O. arm with much better positioning and focus control than by bellows.

Zooming the Leitz image
<br>(right-click, "Open image in new tab", then [Ctrl]&amp[+] keys)<br>
reveals that only about the center third is nearly focussed;
<br>this objective wants to be used with a 3.3X relay lens..
<a name=LEITZNFK><h4>Leitz 10X with NFK 3.3X</h4></a>
Repurposing available bellows, EF and T2 extension tubes with adapters<br>
yields nearly 140mm parfocal distance for Leitz objective to NFK 3.3X relay lens<br>
and 150mm projection distance to APS-C sensor.<br><br>

NFK 3.3X corrections designed for Olympus objectives cause
chromatic focus differences from Leitz 10X alone.<br><br>
With 40mm RGB LED halo on Leitz objective,
M55E stylus is better illuminated.<br>
Additional 3.3X magnification allows use of blue LED for better optical resolution<br>

<a name=AO10NFK><h4>A.O. 10X with NFK 3.3X</h4></a>
Finding the stylus with a microscope objective is easier using conventional oculars<br>
 than with camera Live View and projection ocular.<br>
Since the head has an infinity tube lens, this requires infinity objectives.<br>
Since Series 10 AO Spencers often include a 10X objective, how well does one work on a stylus?<br>
Because they are smaller in diameter than MEIJI and Leitz objectives<br>
for which cardstock half-cylinders were epoxied to LED halos, a shim was cut from clear vinyl tubing.<br>
<img src="AO10Xshim.jpg"><br clear=all>
This particular objective appears to have about 4mm working distance.<br>
With halo illumination, stylus tip is better illuminated with cartridge vertical centerline<br>
rotated more nearly 60 than 45 degrees from horizontal, reducing stylus surface in focus.
<p>
With NFK 3.3X relay lens and about 200mm projection distance,<br>
full field of view with APS-C sensor is usefully in focus;<br>
