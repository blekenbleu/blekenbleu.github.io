Stylus image capture employs a 10x epi microscope objective with darkfield illumination and Olympus NFK 3.3x projection ocular into a Canon DSLR.<br>
To hold the stylus at ~45 degrees, the cartridge was mounted in a headshell
with no finger lift and clamped at the bayonet connector using a clothespin:

A bellows is not necessary; &nbsp extension tubes suffice, with more length yielding greater magnification.<br>
The resulting image has decent resolution, but poor contrast.<br>

This microscope has short working distance objectives; &nbsp
the 20x objective would not clear this stylus' plastic grip at this angle.<br>
90 degree shots will clear but require image stacking; &nbsp
whether objective darkfield illumination will then
highlight stylus wear spots remains to be seen.<br>
<br>
Using a camera with zoomed Live View eases focusing.<br>
Silent shutter (Canon's mode 2) and remote shutter release minimize vibration during exposures.<br>
Replacing halogen illumination with blue LEDs may improve image resolution.<br>
<br>
Canon DSLRs with Live View and silent shutter (e.g. 40D) can be had used for less than $100.<br>
Monocular microscope heads typically cost much less than trinoculars,<br>
and used eyetube camera adapter clamps go for around $15.<br>
Eyetube adapters typically have T2 threads, requiring an additional camera-to-T2 adapter.<br>
A projection ocular and extension tubes should cost less than $100;<br>
the trick is obtaining a more or less complete microscope with epi illumination and bright/darkfield objectives.<br>
Starting from scratch, I would look for Nikon 210mm B/D objectives...<br>
<br>
To investigate contrast, <a href="https://www.vinylengine.com/turntable_forum/viewtopic.php?p=1034041#p1034041">Ray Parkhurst</a> suggested 
removing the camera and looking down into the tube.<br>
Internal surfaces were not reflecting appreciable light,
but a small bright spot and dim blob were seen in the optic at the bottom of the eyetube.<br>
Lacking a ground glass, I laid wax paper over the camera adapter:<br>
<table border="0"><tr><td>

</td</tr></table>
The dim blob is revealed as the projected stylus.<br>
The bright spot appears less focused than when viewed directly and, depending on viewing angle,
more or less distinct from the projected stylus image.<br>
<p align=center>
Completely removing the microscope head and looking down into the body<br>
reveals a bright spot centered in an epi illuminator lens<br>
as well as a less bright spot on the lower lip of that port.<br>
<img src="EpiSpot.jpg" align=center><br clear=all>
I suppose that bright spot provokes flare in the tube lens of the removed head.<br>
An A.O. #3002 image erector spaced the head further from the epi illuminator<br>
and slightly improved contrast, despite adding more optics in the path:<br>

Microscopes better resolve by blue illumination, since shorter wavelength
and less opportunity for chromatic aberrations.<br>
A <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FWX19QS">40mm RGB LED halo ring</a> fits around microscope objectives and can be supported by a 20mm i.d. o-ring.
<br> <img src="

<br>Since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_filter">Bayer-filtered camera sensors</a> have relatively sparse blue pixels,<br> aliasing is liable for images with less than 4x oversampling.<br> <img src="
BlueM55E.jpg

The dark wedge along the center of the above blue M55E stylus image turns out to be surface not in focus.<br>
That o-ring below LED halo blocks some illumination; 
<br>the next revision glued
a curled strip of business card as a half-cylinder to the halo backside...
<p align=center> ...allowing an o-ring to secure LEDs on the objective from above:<br>

Rotating the headshell in the clothespin to bring more of the stylus upper surface more nearly in focus <br> and using green light instead of blue to involve more camera pixels yields the following:<br>

Contrast could be improved by putting something flat black between the cantilever and its light plastic grip.

An infinity objective set acquisition a dozen years ago<br>
also included a LEITZ WETZLAR 160/- EF 10/0.25<br>
with 6.8 mm working distance <a href="http://science-info.net/docs/leitz/LeitzLaborluxK-D-Brochure.pdf">(Laborlux K-D brochure page 14)</a><br>
A recently acquired RMS to T2 adapter enables macrophotography experiments.<br>
Having been attached using hot glue,<br>
the RGB LED ring light mounting sleeve failed during an extended session;<br>
illumination temporarily reverted to white LED gooseneck while epoxy cures.

Increased spacing between objective and focal plane<br>
in theory <a href="http://www.science-info.net/docs/etc/Tube-Length-na.gif">impacts numerical aperture</a>,<br>
but trials with bellows did not indicate any drastic effects,<br>
with results compromised by difficulty focusing.<br>
Eliminating all optics but objective should have increased contrast,<br>
but illumination differences and reduction in magnification confound comparison.

Here is a 1:1 crop of that stylus tip from an APS-C Canon sensor:<br>

With camera body attached to a microscope, zoomed live view eases focusing,<br>
but using objectives with bellows mostly demonstrated<br>
limitations of conventional photography focus rails.<br>
Resolution in this setup may also be constrained by sensor pixel density..<br>

 50.5mm dovetail to M42 adapter arrived from
 
 <a href="https://rafcamera.com/microscope-dovetail-adapter-50-4mm-to-m42x1">RAF Camera</a>.<br>

 This secures camera body and extender tubes to A.O. arm without head (and tube lens).<br>
Finite objectives can then be used in A.O. arm with much better positioning and focus control than by bellows.

10X is not nearly enough to fill APS-C sensor with stylus:<br>

Making this image was much easier than with bellows,
except for positioning the LED to approximately match illumination.
