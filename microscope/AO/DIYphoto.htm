While the <a href="../PhotoStar.htm">restomod PhotoStar</a> has decent image quality,<br>
it over-magnifies, strongly cropping compared to oculars.
Also, since AO tube lens at the trinocular head entrance
substantially corrects AO objectives, direct focus on camera sensor should have low aberrations.</td>

20mm o.d. 17mm i.d. aluminum tubes arrived 20 July from Amazon.
After marking one tube for the length of PhotoStar shutter 0.8-inch trinocular head insert,
ran an 18mm tap into it to break reflections and also enable that tap shank to be clamped in drill press chuck.
Cutting off that threaded tube section broke a (copper) tubing cutter after creating a groove,
which helped complete squarely cutting it off in a band saw, but killed economics for this project.

Unscrewing the mini-lathe chuck's 14mm shank allowed inserting the tape shank thru it
to be clamped by the drill press chuck, while lathe chuck jaws clamped the tubing.
This was a first opportunity to employ a M20x0.75 die which had been recommended as a usefule approximation to RMS 0.8-inch/36tpi.
Sadly, this die does not fit my metric die holder, so was instead gripped by channel-lock pliers while the drill press bed
was raised up against the aluminum tube stub and 18mm tap.  The lathe chuck needed retightening several times to apply enough
torque for cutting 20mm threads.

About 6 threads suffice to fully screw thru M42-RMS step-down ring depth.
Since this is is not a perfect fit, and a relatively heavy and expensive camera is to be supported,
JB Weld will be applied to both threads before final assembly, and matte black acrylic paint
will be applied to internal 18mm threads and tube ends.

Barely enough tap shank protruded from the lathe chuck to be clamped in the drill press chuck,
but this was only for vertical alignment, not to apply any forces for 20mm thread cutting.

Trial fit of 20mm-threaded tube stub into M42-RMS step-down ring;  bright internal thread obviously wants obscuring.
Another M42-RMS step-down ring is on order to replace the one borrowed from 4x objective on 55-250mm zoom lens for macro photography.

Stacked M42 extension tubes and EF adapter to approximate tube lens focal distance,
roughly accounting for Canon EF flange-to sensor-distance.  Parfocality will want an M42 focusing helicoid.
Slack between 20mm tube and AO 0.8-inch trinocular port will be addressed
by wrapping the stub with pressure-sensitive aluminum HVAC tape.
