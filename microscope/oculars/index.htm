This exercise captured differences in views of Nikon's M Plan 40X 0.65 n.a. 210/0 by 3 oculars,<br>
namely Nikon's CFWN 10X-22, a generic Chinese WF10X 18mm high point<br>
(which had been acquired to use with eyeglasses on an AO 120),<br>
and another Chinese WF10X/22 acquired to use with eyeglasses instead of the CFWN 10X-22 on an Optiphot-66.<br>
<img src="suspects.jpg"><br clear=all><br>
The Optiphot being used still suffers from slowly sinking stage, requiring frequent refocusing.<br>
<img src="TrinocTclamp.jpg"><br clear=all><br>
That stage was accidently bumped during ocular changes;<br>
orientation of the calibration slide differs slightly between images.<br>
Here is the WF10X 18mm peeking from a repurposed 1.25-inch telescope clamp<br>
(which fits Niknon's trinocular T, but not F, head).<br>
<img src="clamped18mm.jpg"><br clear=all><br>
and an M42 focusing helicoid, which was adjusted to approximately equalize ocular-to-40mm lens spacing.<br>
<img src="scene.jpg"><br clear=all><br>
To my eye, the WF10X-18mm and WF10X/22 views are quite similar, except for field-of-view.<br>
Afocal images captured using Canon 40mm pancake lens with a 6D instead of APC body<br>
to capture nearly full field from M Plan 40x 0.65 210/0<br>
with fixed manual camera settings (f/2.4, 1/20 sec, ISO 4000)<br>
<img src="WF10X-18mm.jpg"><br clear=all><br>
The WF10X-22 is too large for the clamp, but the helicoid was used to help register the 40mm lens over it.<br>
I had to hand-hold the camera for WF10X/22 and forgot to rotate the 6D from landscape orientation.<br>
The 6D evidently found this WF10X-22 significantly brighter than the WF10X-18mm:

Visually, the CFWN10X-20 has lower contrast,<br>
with calibration markings never appearing black when best focused.<br>

Something obscures upper right edge for FoV &gt; 18 in trinocular T left eye tube;<br>
that happens neither in the right T eye tube nor either trinocular F eye tube,<br>
which gets used for most imaging because of its empty photo tube.<br>

Could have paid $3 less @ AliExpress, but without rubber eye guards:<br>

A pair of WF10X-18mm eyepieces were acquired in 2020 for an AO 120.<br>
AO 180 oculars are OK, but lack relief for eyeglasses, which are not optional.<br>
I was pleasantly surprised that corrections, if any, match so far as I can tell.<br>
Nikon CFWN 10X/20 eyepieces are problematic for me, not only<br>
lacking eyeglass relief, but also somehow provoking floaters to substantially obscure viewing.<br>
Thankfully, WF10X/22 oculars, purchase June 2021 based on<br>
<a href="https://www.photomacrography.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=40224">https://www.photomacrography.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=40224</a><br>
seemingly match CFWN (lack of) corrections, work with eyeglasses mashed to them and mitigate floaters.<br>
Curiously, CFWN 10X/20 oculars seem better in the AO 120, aggravating floaters less than in the Optiphot..??<br>
The AO 120 is IMO a better diascopic microscope than the Optiphot,<br> but I am more interested in episcopic microscopy.<br>
