<h4><a href="https://www.photomacrography.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=234060#p234060">Abednego1995: CF/CFD/CFN(NCF) oculars lineup</a></h4>
<p style="page-break-after: always;"> 
This exercise captured differences in views of Nikon's M Plan 40X 0.65 n.a. 210/0 by 3 oculars,<br>
namely Nikon's CFWN 10X-20, a generic Chinese WF10X 18mm high point<br>
(which had been acquired to use with eyeglasses on an AO 120),<br>
and another Chinese WF10X/22 acquired to use with eyeglasses instead of the CFWN 10X-20 on an Optiphot-66.<br>
<img src="suspects.jpg"><br clear=all><br>
The Optiphot being used still suffers from slowly sinking stage, requiring frequent refocusing.<br>
<img src="TrinocTclamp.jpg"><br clear=all><br>
That stage was accidently bumped during ocular changes;<br>
orientation of the calibration slide differs slightly among images.<br>
Here is the WF10X 18mm peeking from a repurposed 1.25-inch telescope clamp<br>
(which fits Nikon's trinocular T, but not F, head).<br>
<img src="clamped18mm.jpg"><br clear=all><br>
and an <a href=../helicoid>M42 focusing helicoid</a>, which was adjusted to approximately equalize ocular-to-40mm lens spacing.<br>
<img src="scene.jpg"><br clear=all><br>
To my eye, the WF10X-18mm and WF10X/22 views are quite similar, except for field-of-view.<br>
Afocal images captured using Canon 40mm pancake lens with a 6D instead of APC body<br>
capture nearly full field from M Plan 40x 0.65 210/0<br>
with fixed manual camera settings (f/2.4, 1/20 sec, ISO 4000)<br>
<img src="WF10X-18mm.jpg"><br clear=all><br>
The WF10X-22 is too large for the clamp, but the helicoid helped register the 40mm lens over it.<br>
I had to hand-hold the camera for WF10X/22 and forgot to rotate the 6D from landscape orientation.<br>
The 6D evidently found this WF10X-22 significantly brighter than the WF10X-18mm:
<img src="WF10X-22.jpg"><br clear=all><br>
Visually, the CFWN10X-20 has lower contrast,<br>
with calibration markings never appearing black when best focused.<br>
<img src="CFWN10X-20.jpg"><br clear=all><br>
Something obscures upper right edge for FoV &gt; 18 in trinocular T left eye tube;<br>
that happens neither in the right T eye tube nor either trinocular F eye tube,<br>
which gets used for most imaging because of its empty photo tube.<br>

Could have paid $3 less @ AliExpress, but without rubber eye guards:<br>

A pair of WF10X-18mm eyepieces were acquired in 2020 for an AO 120.<br>
AO 180 oculars are OK, but lack relief for eyeglasses, which are not optional.<br>
I was pleasantly surprised that corrections, if any, match so far as I can tell.<br>
Nikon CFWN 10X/20 eyepieces are problematic for me, not only<br>
lacking eyeglass relief, but also somehow provoking floaters to substantially obscure viewing.<br>
Thankfully, WF10X/22 oculars, purchase June 2021 based on<br>
<a href="https://www.photomacrography.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=40224">https://www.photomacrography.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=40224</a><br>
seemingly match CFWN (lack of) corrections, work with eyeglasses mashed to them and mitigate floaters.<br>
Curiously, CFWN 10X/20 oculars seem better in the AO 120, aggravating floaters less than in the Optiphot..??<br>
The AO 120 is IMO a better diascopic microscope than the Optiphot,<br> but I am more interested in episcopic microscopy.<br>
Another pair of high point oculars are wanted for the second Optiphot,<br>
but benefits of 22 over 20 FoV do not for me justify their higher cost.

Not quite parfocal with Leica 10445111, but seemingly larger FoV than marked 21 vs 23.<br>  
As hoped, no appreciable aberrations (with Nikon M Plan 210/0 objectives), but also no eyeguards;<br> 
<img src="WF10X-23side.jpg"><br clear=all>
...those purchased for Nikon CFWN 10X-20 eyepieces work better (reversed) on these.<br>
