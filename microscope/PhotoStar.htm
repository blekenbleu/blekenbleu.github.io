<h4>Background</h4>
Despite offering a so-called Trinocular Parfocal Tube for their microscopes,<br>
(with <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/325261361205">clones available on eBay</a>,
AO seemingly produced few dedicated photo relay lenses,<br>
also called projection oculars or photo eyepieces.<br>
Their 1054 ocular was described as "Field of View Eyepiece",<br>
but 10x would be too high power for 35mm photo relay.<br>
It was probably to be swapped in place of a regular eyepiece simply to aid FoV composition.<br>
Meanwhile, AO did offer a <a href="https://user.xmission.com/~psneeley/Personal/Series_10_Catalog_1974.pdf">1053 35mm camera back with 1057 lens and trinocular assembly</a>:<br>
<img src="Images/AO1053.jpg"><br clear=all>
That lens and assembly is adapted here to an M42 focus confirm adapter for Canon EOS bodies,<br>
via T2 to M42 adapter:<br>

... which happens to fit concentrically:<br>
<img src="Images/EF-T2-AO.jpg"><br clear=all>
... over the circular dovetail flange from an AO 35mm camera body:<br>
<img src="Images/AOcamera.jpg"><br clear=all>
as an alternative to some clone or improvised photo tube and non-AO photo eyepiece.<br>
JB Weld secures the T2 adapter to the AO camera flange.<br>
<br>
The shutter is easily removed from AO's 1057 (or similar) Shutter, Cable and Lens Assembly.<br>
Holes left in that assembly by shutter removal were covered by pressure sensitive aluminum tape.<br>
Despite specifying 2.8X and 5X magnification factors, the lever so labeled is for focus, not zoom,<br>
with magnification determined by spacing from that lens to the camera sensor.<br>
With no extension tubes, objective field more than fills an APS-C sensor:<br>

<br>
Even with a full 35mm sensor and no extra extension tubes,<br>
images from the PhotoStar lens are substantially cropped from views with 20mm oculars.<br>
DSLR flange-to-sensor spacing and a relatively thick T2-to-M42 adapter share some blame;<br>
a mirrorless 35mm body with thin flange-to-M42 adapter would reduce cropping.<br>
My restomod's camera image is not perfectly centered, but I judge image sharpness,<br>
as viewed on a 60-inch TV from Canon 6D HDMI, fairly comparable to that from oculars.<br>
Being able to tweak parfocality with AO's 2.8X - 5X slider helps.<br>
