### Macro links:  Mark Goodman, Allan Walls, Andy Murray and Rik Littlefield  

Mark Goodman's [CoinImaging.com](https://www.coinimaging.com) website has useful [articles](https://coinimaging.com/photo_articles.html) and [lens tests](https://www.coinimaging.com/lens_tests_new.html).  
Most that I have read by or about Andy Murray is at his website:  
<https://www.chaosofdelight.org>  

.. under ABOUT and BLOG  
.. but Andy is also on flickr:  
<https://www.flickr.com/photos/andybadger/>  

Sadly, he shares names with a seemingly more popular athlete,  
so Google searches work better with:  Andy Murray springtails  

Here is a provocative web page:
