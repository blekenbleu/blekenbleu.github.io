*Finite-conjugate microscope system vs. infinite-conjugate microscope system with tube lens.*  
from:  [Systematic design of microscope objectives](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333091817_Systematic_design_of_microscope_objectives_Part_I_System_review_and_analysis)  
The vertical dotted line where rays cross at right end of tube length is called the objective's *rear conjugate*.  
To the extent that it is, a finite objective's correction is designed for that tube length,  
keeping in mind than many objectives depend on both slide cover glass and eyepiece for correction.  

Classic (RMS) compound microscope magnification: `m = (L/fo)×(D/fe)`, where:  
- `m` = magnification    
- `L` = tube length (160mm)  
- `D` = normal vision relaxed distance (250mm)  
- `fo` = objective focal length  
- `fe` = eyepiece focal length  

For 160mm tube length, a 10x objective has 16mm focal length  
and a 10x eyepiece has 25mm focal length.  
For infinity scopes, substitute "tube lens focal length" for "tube length".  
Olympus infinity objectives expect 180mm tube lens focal length;  
Nikon Optiphot BD objectives expect 210mm tube length.
