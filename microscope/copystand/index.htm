<h2>Copy stand camera hanger for macro and micro photography</h2>
<img style="float: left; padding: 0px 9px 0px 0px;" src="../PE2.5X6D.jpg">
In the dark ages, when digital cameras were more about convenience than image quality,<br>
I acquired a cheaper but less rigid copy stand than that
employed by e.g. <a href="https://krebsmicro.com/microsetup2/">Charles Krebs</a>:<br>
<img align=right src="https://krebsmicro.com/microsetup2/0045.jpg"><br>
The 1.5" o.d. chromed tube by itself flexes enough to require remote shutter
release, but its pantograph camera mount and a Manfrotto 454 add too much
lost motion for productive macro focus bracketing.<br>
A pair of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FETT3FO">LAMPHUS Cruizer light bar clamps</a> are being repurposed
to rigidly attach a focus bracketing rail. &nbsp Clamps include spacers for
1", 1.5" and 1.75" o.d. tubing, but included screws are too short to engage
with designated spacers, as Amazon reviewers noted. &nbsp Consequently,
mismatched 1.5 and 1.75 spacer halves are used.<br>
