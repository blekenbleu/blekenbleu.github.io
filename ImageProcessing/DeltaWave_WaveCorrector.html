<h2>DeltaWave vs Wave Corrector</h2>
<p>
<em>visualizing differences betweeen music files before and after tick removal</em>
</p>
<h4>What</h4>
<p>
<i><a href="../SL-7/WaveCorrector.html">Wave Corrector</a> selectively removes suspected tick and pops from LP recordings;<br>
<a href="https://deltaw.org/">DeltaWave</a> analyzes differences between music files,
in this case before and after Wave Corrector</i>.<p>
While it may seem obvious that audio signals with no difference will be indistinguishable,
there is actually some data to confirm that.  While double-blind testing is considered by many the best basis for audio preference,
there are to my knowlege few individuals with a track record of being good at it.  "Sterephile" founder <a href="https://www.stereophile.com/category/j-gordon-holt">J. Gordon Holt</a> is one of that few that <a href="https://www.stereophile.com/asweseeit/487awsi/">could and did</a>:<pre>"As far as the real world is concerned, high-end audio lost its credibility during the 1980s,
 when it flatly refused to submit to the kind of basic honesty controls (double-blind testing, for example)
 that had legitimized every other serious scientific endeavor since Pascal.
 [This refusal] is a source of endless derisive amusement among rational people and of perpetual embarrassment for me,
 because I am associated by so many people with the mess my disciples made of spreading my gospel.
 For the record: I never, ever claimed that measurements don't matter.
 What I said (and very often, at that) was, they don't always tell the whole story. Not quite the same thing."

Regardless, in the <a href="https://www.stereophile.com/content/carver-challenge">Carver Challenge</a>, he was unable to distinguish
two very different amplifier designs, one of which by null testing had been <a href="https://www.stereophile.com/content/carver-challenge-page-4">tweaked to match the other</a>.</p>
The track here is "Jesse" from Joan Baez' "Diamonds and Rust" half-speed mastered Nautilus LP.<br>
This record had been cleaned by a Keith Monks machine and StyLast treated before first playing, over 40 years ago.&nbsp
Some younger CDs are no longer playable...<br>
Neither ticks nor pops were noted while recording,<br> but Wave Corrector identified anomalies that seem credible blemishes.<br>
Wave Corrector was run with default settings, except threshold reduced from 3 to 1.<br>
It incorrectly identified several quiet interludes in the song as track breaks;&nbsp; those were corrected.<br>
About 27 seconds of mistracking were recorded at the song start and deleted in the deticked copy.<br>
DeltaWave was unable to match tracks until setting <code>Trim Front:  25 sec</code>;<br>
remaining trash presumably threw off difference metrics.
<h4>Speed up trim trials</h4>

Double-clicking th <code>End</code> option allows specifying seconds to <code>Show</code>.&nbsp (30 works for 96kHz):<br>

Once Trim front value is found by trial and error, viewing overlaid waveforms,<br> then double-click <code>Take</code> back to <code>End [ 0]</code>.<br>
<div align=center><img src="simple.gif"><br clear=all></div>
<font size=-1><i>Explanation</i>:<blockquote>Ah, the problem is that there are more than one points where large portions of the two files can align really well.<br>
DeltaWave can't tell where the alignment points are and guesses that it's a periodic waveform<br>
 (one that has at least a few repeating sections, such as a sinewave, for example).<br>
DW has a different algorithm for dealing with such files, so it offers you to do so.<br>
You don't have to agree to treat it as a simple waveform, but you will be warned.

Here are unalighed waveforms:<br>
<img src="Raw.gif" width=95%><br clear=all>
.. then aligned spectra:<br>
<img src="spectrum.gif" width=95%><br clear=all>
As hoped, waveforms differ only when ticks are corrected:<br>
<img src="waveform.gif" width=95%><br clear=all>
I suppose that a lack of phase differences above 13kHz implies lack of energy:<br>
<img src="phase.gif" width=95%><br clear=all>
As with waveforms, spectrogram delta shows differences only for removed ticks:<br>
<img src="spectrogram.gif" width=95%><br clear=all>
<font size=-1>X-axis time stamp variations were unexpected</font><br>
Linearity spikes are presumably also tick removal artifacts:<br>

Superficial understanding of <a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/pk-error-metric-discussion-and-beta-test.19841/">PK Metric</a> suggests audibility of 2 tick corrections.<br>
<img src="PKmetric.gif" width=95%><br clear=all>
The DF metric suggests something should be rarely audible;<br> that may be from the vestigal 2 first mismatched seconds:<br>

Camera icon at lower left was not noticed until the final screen capture...<br>
According to developer <a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/pk-error-metric-discussion-and-beta-test.19841/post-1562334">pkane, PK dBr better corresponds to audibility</a>:<br>
