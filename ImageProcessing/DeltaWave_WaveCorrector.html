<h2>DeltaWave vs Wave Corrector</h2>
<p>
<em>visualizing differences betweeen music files before and after tick removal</em>
</p>
<h4>What</h4>
<p>
<i><a href="../SL-7/WaveCorrector.html">Wave Corrector</a> selectively removes suspected tick and pops from LP recordings;<br>
<a href="https://deltaw.org/">DeltaWave</a> analyzes differences between music files,
in this case before and after Wave Corrector</i>.<br>
The recording is "Jesse" from Joan Baez' "Diamonds and Rust" half-speed mastered Nautilus LP.<br>
This record had been cleaned by a Keith Monks machine and StyLast treated before first playing, over 40 years ago.&nbsp
Some younger CDs are no longer playable...<br>
Neither ticks nor pops were noted while recording,<br> but Wave Corrector identified anomalies that seem credible blemishes.<br>
Wave Corrector was run with default settings, except threshold reduced from 3 to 1.<br>
It incorrectly identified several quiet interludes in the song as track breaks;&nbsp; those were corrected.<br>
About 27 seconds of mistracking were recorded at the song start and deleted in the deticked copy.<br>
DeltaWave was unable to match tracks until setting <code>Trim Front:  25 sec</code>;<br>
remaining trash presumably threw off difference metrics and may have provoked this popup:

Here are unalighed waveforms:<br>
<img src="Raw.gif" width=95%><br clear=all>
.. then aligned spectra:<br>
<img src="spectrum.gif" width=95%><br clear=all>
As hoped, waveforms differ only when ticks are corrected:<br>

I suppose that a lack of phase differences above 13kHz implies lack of energy:<br>

As with waveforms, spectrogram delta shows differences only for removed ticks:<br>

<font size=-1>X-axis time stamp variations were unexpected</font><br>
Linearity spikes are presumably also tick removal artifacts:<br>

Superficial understanding of <a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/pk-error-metric-discussion-and-beta-test.19841/">PK Metric</a> suggests audibility of 2 tick corrections.<br>
<img src="PKmetric.gif" width=95%><br clear=all>
The DF metric suggests something should be rarely audible;<br> that may be from the vestigal 2 first mismatched seconds:<br>

Camera icon at lower left was not noticed until the final screen capture...<br>
According to developer <a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/pk-error-metric-discussion-and-beta-test.19841/post-1562334">pkane, PK dBr better corresponds to audibility</a>:<br>
