Single-bit mask dither requires <b>2**k</b> samples
to converge for <b>k</b> truncated bits.
Multi-bit mask dither reduces sample neighborhood size required for
dithered interpolation convergence to weighted averages.
A k-bit mask dither generates weighted averages for each sample with <b>k</b> truncated bits.
In general, <b>2**(k-m)</b>
samples are required for <b>m</b>-bit mask dither convergence with
<b>k</b> truncated bits.
More table entries must be accessed, on average, for sampling
with multi-bit mask dither.
<p>For example, consider the case of a 17x17x17
table <b>T[][][]</b> and sets of three 8-bit inputs,
each with 4 truncated bits and using 4-bit mask dither.
Up to 5 different table entries are accessed for each input tuple.
Truncated index values are R,G,B 
and corresponding dither bits are r,g,b: <pre>
  R = red >> 4   ; G = green >> 4   ; B = blue >> 4   
  r = red & 0x0F ; g = green & 0x0F ; b = blue & 0x0F
</pre>
...then 5 table entries and their weights would be:<pre>
  ( T[R + (r & 0x08)>>3][G + (g & 0x08)>>3][B + (b & 0x08)>>3]<<3
  + T[R + (r & 0x04)>>2][G + (g & 0x04)>>2][B + (b & 0x04)>>2]<<2
  + T[R + (r & 0x02)>>1][G + (g & 0x02)>>1][B + (b & 0x02)>>1]<<1
  + T[R + (r & 0x01)][G + (g & 0x01)][B + (b & 0x01)] + T[R][G][B] ) >> 4 
</pre>
This implementation generates a weighted average for each sample.
<p>Alternatively, here is code for a 2-bit mask dither of 4 truncated bits
that converges to weighted average over neighborhoods of 8 samples:
<pre> shift[] = {3,2,3,1,3,2,3,0};

for(i=0; i &lt end; i++) {		/* for all samples */
   r = RGB[0][i]; g = RGB[1][i]; b = RGB[2][i]; /* sample data */
   R = r >> 4; G = g >> 4; B == B >> 4;	/* truncate to index sparse table T[][][] */
   m = shift[i & 0x07];			/* select the shift for this sample */
   if( 0 == m ) {			/* special case lsb */
     /* 4 bits have 16 possible values;
    /*  for convergence with 8 samples, the lsb and 0 each have weight 0.5 */
     weighted_average[i] = (T[R+(r & 1)][G+(g & 1)][B+(b & 1)] + T[R][G][B])>>1;
   }
   else {
#define  mask(c) ((c>>m) & 1);	/* test a bit */
	/* increment indices with masked bits */
     weighted_average[i] = T[R+mask(r)][G+mask(g)][B+mask(b)]<<(m-1);
   }
}</pre>
<p>
For <b>n</b>-dimensional interpolation, up to <b>2**n</b> table entries are accessed.<br>
Considering 3-dimensional interpolations, trilinear accesses all 8 nearest entries,
 while tetrahedral accesses 4 of the 8.
However, tetrahedral requires some additional calculation to determine
which 4 of 8 entries should be selected.  Mask dither accesses up to one
more table entry than the number of truncated bits.
Four-bit dither of 4 truncated bits accesses
up to 5 different table entries for interpolation of each sample.
This is up to one more table access than tetrahedral, but with less computational
complexity.  On the other hand, geometric interpolation over more than
three dimensions will require more than 4 table accesses,
while table accesses for mask dither is no more than 1 + truncated bit count,
independent of table dimensions.
Multi-bit dither with less than truncated bit count allows a
tradeoff of average table access per sample vs convergence to average
over sample neighborhoods than for single-bit mask dither.
This is a classic instance of oversampling frequency vs signal precision.
