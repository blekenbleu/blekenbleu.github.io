## Time lurches on: MS Flight Simulator 2020 vs [Alienware Area 51 R2](https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000178577/alienware-area-51-r2-system-specifications)  
- FS2020 is largely about visuals, e.g. 1440p, 30fps and Ultra settings  
  - at least 2 PC versions (MS Store, Steam), 3 editions and numerous revisions.  
    Performance tweaks differ among versions and revisions
  - [**Google Maps MOD for the entire world!**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E11XsrBdzcg) offering generally better visuals  
- [RTX 1080 Ti is capable of > 30fps](https://www.tomshardware.com/features/microsoft-flight-simulator-benchmarks-performance-system-requirements)

- i7-5960X CPU is **NOT capable**; even overclocked cannot maintain 30fps @ 1080p; need *at least* 9900k

  - [8-core Parts](https://cpu.userbenchmark.com) i7-5960X @ 744; i9-9900k @ 972;  **i5-12400F @ 974**

    Note that AMD 5600 CPUs are using much slower and cheaper DDR4-3600

    - Core i5-12400 NoPL DDR4-3800: Corsair H115i 280mm water cooler, power limits removed,  
      memory overclocked to DDR4-3800 in Gear 1 mode (Gear 2 results in performance regressions)
    - Core i5-12400: Corsair H115i 280mm water cooler, power limits removed,  
      Stock DDR4-3200 in Gear 1
    - Core i5-12400 StockPL: Corsair H115i 280mm water cooler, PL1=65W, PL2=169W,  
      128-second boost (Tau), Stock DDR4-3200 in Gear 1  

### Upgrade candidate:  [ASRock H670 PG RIPTIDE LGA 1700 Intel H670 SATA 6Gb/s DDR4 ATX Motherboard](https://www.newegg.com/p/N82E16813162044)  
[H670 motherboards offer best LGA-1700 performance short of CPU overclocking](H670ATX).  
[2 more rear USB 3.2 Gen1 ports](https://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/H670%20PG%20Riptide) than H670 Steel Legend;   
also low-latency "Lightning Gaming Ports" for mouse and keyboard  
- potential issue:  AMD CPUs seem more liable to thermal throttling;  Area 51 R2 cooling is problematic..  

Rule of thumb:  CPU most affects refresh rate;  GPU most affects resolution.  
- 30fps suffices for e.g. commercial planes, probably neither dogfights nor stunt flying.  

#### Aug 2020 Optimal settings for Flight Simulator - Nvidia
 "Live real-world air traffic" and "Live Weather" are the most taxing options, especially on the CPU.  

The game has an option to lock 30 FPS which not only will reduce GPU load  
but will also provide enough headroom to increase graphical settings a notch.

#### 100% load with GTX 1080ti
"Key is not to overload the CPU with Terrain LOD, never ever go past 100."

#### [*CPU sweet spot: 6 cores and 6 threads*](https://www.dsogaming.com/pc-performance-analyses/microsoft-flight-simulator-pc-performance-analysis)  
- $300 5600x should be just as good as the $800 5950x

"The biggest issue is that you need to connect 2 cables  
 from your new Motherboard to the FIO board: One is an usb3 header cable,  
 which you need if you still want to use the 2 front usb connections.  
The other cable is an usb2 header cable that you need to connect  
 between the FIO board and the FIO connector on the motherboard.  
This is needed so you can power on the mobo using the alien power switch.  
For this I used a normal (long enough) usb2 header cable,  
 and made a small hole in both sides of the cable  
 so it will fit the pins on the mobo and FIO board."

Changing the power supply would require hacking a cable
to power the logic/IO board.  
Original motherboard power on timing is incompatible with generic power supplies.
