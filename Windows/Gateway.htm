Seagate tools cannot handle Sabrent USB3 SATA correctly -
sees 4TB seagate drive as two
1. SCSI-FC-SAS s/n 32118 with no model number
2.  USB-1394 with Jmicron model number and no serial number

Sabrent dock sucks on Windows with 4GB drives
* partitions and formatting via eSATA are not recognized via Sabrent USB 3.0
and vice versa.

Windows 8.1 Device Manager sees it as Jmicron SCSI Disk Device
Windows 8.1 sees 4 Recovery partitions on the internal 1TB ST31000524AS
AOEMEI Partition Assistant labels only the first as Recovery,
  but all 4 have the same flags (GPT, WRE=Windows Recovery Environment)
  MSR=Microsoft Reserved partition

In Windows 8.1, ran sfc /scannow
Microsoft Windows [Version 6.3.9600]
(c) 2013 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

C:\Windows\system32>sfc /scannow

Beginning system scan.  This process will take some time.

Beginning verification phase of system scan.
Verification 100% complete.

Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some
of them. Details are included in the CBS.Log windir\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. For
example C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. Note that logging is currently not
supported in offline servicing scenarios.

Evidently sfc can generate false positives....

AOMEI Backupper made a bad image backup of newgate's 1TB drive on 4TB Seagate
but mounted the backup image partitions to explore as J:-R:
J: appears to be the OEM restore partition (probably Windows 8)
K:ESP\EFI still contains an ubuntu folder from 2014;
    Boot and Microsoft folders both have 7/2017 content
L: was the 4TB seagate
M: is the Win 8.1 C: drive
N: is a recovery partition from 8/2015 2015; directory contents not visible
O: is NewWin10
P is a recovery partition with 7/18/2017 folder timestamp
Q has no Recovery folder; Sys Vol is dated 2/4/2015
R is Gateway_20GB with VBoxShared folder from 9/25/2014 Hello from Mint

AOMEI Backuppper updated to 4.04 still would not write to internal SATA DVD drive
but will write to USB-attached Sony drive, although it hangs at the end.
 Neither version 3 nor 4 could create bootable Dell 500MB flash,
but succeeded on second try (fter Windows format) on SanDisk cruzer 4GB
Gateway would not boot UEFI CD, did not recognized BIOS CD as bootable
After failing UEFI CD boot (internal or Sony USB), Gateway will not boot hard drive
until after recovery boot e.g. from Windows 10 install USB flash.

Removed Steven\Videos folder from C: drive, freeing much space.
Disk Cleanup pause for a long time for setup log files, system error logs, windows update cleanup.

Could not reboot after deleting empty recovery partition; booted using Insider USB Flash

AOMEI Backupper failed to restore Win 8.1 system to replacement SanDisk 500GB via Sabrent;
succeeded via eSATA..  Rebooted, stopping in BIOS to change boot disk priority to eSATA SanDisk also succeeded in booting restored Win8.  Rebooting again and selecting Windows 10
booted it from primary (but lower boot priority) 1TB drive.

GTX 650 Ti has a pair of dual-DVI + mini-HDMI, but no DisplayPort ( DP )
CX430 ( 430 Watt) power supply should work for
GTX 650 Ti Boost, 660, 660 Ti, 960, 970, 1070?
https://video-nvidia.com/en-us/energy-nvidia-geforce

For DisplayPort, GTX 1050 Ti uses less power (75 vs 110W)
and 7720/4390 performance

GTX 1650 same 75W, but faster
Some not DisplayPort? Some not Windows 8.1?
DVI not dual-link?

Get a DP GPU for Gateway and a second DisplayPort-to-dual-link DVI adapter  for
 Alienware Aurora R7 below GTX 1080 TI?
