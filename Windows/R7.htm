<title>Alienware Aurora R7 crashing and overheating</title>

<h2>Alienware Aurora R7 crashing and overheating</h2>
To celebrate its 5th anniversary, the Aurora R7 began crashing,
presumably from CPU overheating.<br>
This Alienware PC has proprietary case, motherboard, power supply
and puny liquid cooling;&nbsp access is also poor.
<a href="https://crystalmark.info/en/software/crystaldiskinfo/">CrystalDiskInfo</a>
running in notification area monitors hard drive health;
something comparable is wanted for cooling.<br>

<h3>Disassembly, cleaning, disconnecting and reassembling</h3>
Unlike its case design, R7 service manual is not terrible but far underplays
top cover removal difficulty, but which is absolutely required
for access to absurdly tiny but clogged CPU cooling radiator.<br>

<h4>GPU</h4>According to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5STAvOxhF7U">this video</a>,
GTX 1080Ti graphics card shroud removal risks destroying screws,<br>
but Garrett Wade bit removed screws with no issues.<br>
Graphics card dust was thoroughly removed by 100+psi compressed air before disassembly;<br>
GPU thermal paste was not too dry:<br>
<img width=100% src=image/GTX1080Ti.jpg><br clear=all><br>

While disconnecting and reconnecting most motherboard connectors,
notably excepting the CPU itself,<br>
the main motherboard power connector felt like it may not have been
fully seated,<br>
amd one DRAM SIMM may not have been fully engaged at its upper end.<br>
Power supply connectors are color coded and well-labeled.<br>
<br>
According to
<a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/how-to-check-cpu-temp-temperature">Tom's
 Review</a>:<br>
"Most thermal paste's performance seriously degrades after about three years."<br>
.. Thermal Grizzly Hydronaut is now on order.
<h3>Thermal Paste</h3>
Replaced thermal paste on both GPU and CPU;
supplied spatula is too stiff and should have a bent handle.<br>
Laid R7 on its right side to remove 4 top screws holding radiator
so that it could move toward the motherboard and tilt to minimize strain on coolant hoses
as pump was unscrewed and tipped toward the case front for access to clean dried paste from it and the CPU.<br>
A rubber band around power cables constrained the pump in a convenient position.<br><br>

Less than half a sheet of paper towel, in a few torn pieces, was used with alcohol to remove dried paste.<br>
One cotton swab sufficed to wipe paste traces from around CPU edges.<br>
Original paste almost completely covered the CPU surface with negligible spillover.

<h3>After reassembly</h3>
BIOS, but not diagnostics, were available by F2 during boot.<br>
<a href="https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000181163/how-to-enter-the-built-in-diagnostics-32-bit-diagnostics-supportassist-epsa-epsa-and-psa">
F12 launched another menu with diagnostic option</a>,
but disconnected cover LED connectors preempted that.<br>

After restoring LED connections to silly covers, F12 diagnostics passed for CPU and other hardware in a few minutes, then launched 3.5hr memory test.<br>

Preboot diagnostics reported no errors; rebooted Windows<br>

How to Remove and Reinstall the Alienware Command Center</a><br>
Manually updated BIOS from Dell support,
then let Dell download SupportAssist,<br>
 which failed to install even after restart...<br>
Downloaded all available updates to Download\Dell\<br>
then moved to Download\Dell\installed\ after success;<br>
installed in listed order, except Command Center after Intel graphics
 and before serial, to monitor temperatures...<br>
Despite having Startup Mode set to Windows Startup,<br>
Command Center would not start after reboots until launched by shortcut..<br>
-&gt changed setting to Manual

Alienware thermal monitor app showed pump running:<br>

GPU-Z CPU Temperature fluctuates abruptly, suggesting liquid cooler failure:<br>

Corsair H60 was reportedly a bolt-in replacement, but no longer available.<br>
3 users report using
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CNXHYJ2">
EVGA CL11 CLC 120mm AIO ($65)</a>
 on R6,12 with Alienware fan.<br>
==> ordered<br>
One test for low AIO coolant is different line temperatures.<br>
However, checking  that is practically impossible with PSU blocking access.<br>
After powering down and opening, lines were not so different;<br>
with pump not running, hot water equalizes.

<h3>Liquid cooler replacement</h3>
Original R7 and EVGA replacement AIOs are both asetek 120mm;&nbsp
radiators seem identical:<ul compact>
<li> EVGA hoses are longer;&nbsp rotated new pump 90cw to allow more hose curl
<li> EVGA pump plug is 3-pin, but 4th A7 pin was jumpered to ground
  which might have blown motherboard PWM driver to that pin..?
<li> EVGA pump hose connectors are vertical to motherboard, while A7 are parallel,
  causing EVGA hoses to be pressed down appreciably by R7 power supply.&nbsp
 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0986TNM7V">Replacement A7 AIO is $165</a>
<li> Paste on EVGA cold plate was dry and stiff;&nbsp unlikely to spread well under pressure.<br>Replaced by fresh paste.
<li> new fan was thinner 3-wire;&nbsp re-used R7 thicker 4-wire
<li> identical pump mounting;&nbsp  re-used R7 attachment ring and thumb screws
</ul>
<h4>Temperatures unaffected by AIO replacement</h4>
Either neither or both are bad.<br>
GPU-Z and Alienware Thermal Controls<br>
seemingly monitor different CPU and fan sensors:<br>

<h4>Next:&nbsp open and refill R7 AIO pump</h4>
