<h3>AT-LP140XP microphonics, mats, covers</h3>
<h4>nonslip mat</h4>
Seemingly, primary motivations for felt mats are reduced costand facilitating DJ pitch bending and slip cueing.<br>
On the other hand, my turntable mat wish list includes:
<ul compact>
<li>good grip  - speed stability cannot be ideal with slipping LPs
<li>more thickness  - 1.5mm felt mat provided e.g. with AT-LP140BX<br>
 wants vertical tracking angle at or below adjustment lower limit
<li>minimize dirt and damage  - felt attracts dirt and is hard to clean
<li>LP disc vibration attenuation  - including immediate reactions to needle tracing<br>
 and ambient e.g. feedback from loudspeakers
</ul>
<p>
While I eventually intend to measure frequency response sweeps from test records with different mats,<br>
 initial measurements are phono signals from a needle resting half-way thru an idle LP stimulated by loudspeaker frequency sweeps.<br>
These measurements are confounded by loudspeaker response, room resonances, turntable platform rigidity and chassis isolation,<br> so <em>only interesting for <b>changes</b> in response</em>.
</p><p>
In this case, the turntable platform is 20mm MDF standing on concrete slab with engineered flooring, so minimal "trampoline effects".<br>
Unlike traditional (e.g. belt-drive) turntables,<br>
which typically have flat platter surfaces with LP contact determined by rubber mat ridges,<br>
the AT-LP140BX platter has an edge lip with an abrupt surface recess reducing gradually towards the center,<br>
so that support for flat LPs is only at edge and label even with a clamp.<br>
Consequently, LP grooves in between are are free to respond as diaphragms.<br>
Custom molded or highly resilient mats could fill that gap,
but (unless ribbed) risk driving mat debris into underside LP grooves.<br>
</p><p>
As an expedient spacer for provided 1.5mm felt, a 295mm diameter mat was cut from tool box liner:<br>

</p><p>
Using REW (Room EQ Wizard),
felt pad cartridge signal measurements of loudspeaker sweeps indicate that<br>
microphonics are generally comparable with cover down or removed,
with most differences below 350Hz:<br>
<img src="closed_removed.png"><br clear=all>
Sharp nulls suggest mechanically conducted vibration into platter from base cancelling
airborne energy into LP.
</p><p>
The extent to which acoustic energy travels up from stand through feet and chassis vs cover effectiveness,<br>
despite mechanical coupling of cover to plinth to platter, remains to be determined.<br>
However, sharp nulls suggest that they are comparable.
</p><p>
Similarly, benefits of mat isolating LPs from energy conducted into platter
vs damping LP vibrations by mat and platter area work items.<br>
Here are some evidence from REQ (Room EQ Wizard):<br>
<img src="felt_tool_mat.jpg"><br clear=all>
Trace 3 averages 1 and 2, which are of provided felt mat over tool mat.<br>
The orange trace of tool mat and green trace of felt mat indicate that<br>
more is generally better, but dip around 5.5Hz for felt and 12Hz for tool mat may be meaningful.<br>
The 12Hz dip may be cancellation broadened by tool mat damping,
but the 5.5Hz dip looks like a resonance.<br>
By analogy with electronics, we know that there are two kinds of resonance: high impedance for parallel and low impedance for serial.<br>
It could be that felt presents a high impedance resonance @ ~5.5Hz to energy from platter,<br>
while tool mat may present a high impedance @ ~12Hz,<br>
but it seems more likely IMO that mats instead present low impedance (sinking acoustic energy from LP to platter) at resonances.<br>
</p><p>
Here is more evidence:<br>
<img src="both.jpg"><br clear=all>
This compares felt over tool mat vs tool over felt, so arguably the same series impedance between platter and LP,<br>
 but note dips at both ~ 6 and 11Hz,<br>
which suggest that the tool pad couples better to the LP, supposing that energy is being sinked from LP to platter.<br>
<h4>Aftermarket cover?</h4>
For clarity and before evaluating traditional mat alternatives,<br>
measurements are wanted with more inert turntable stand and<br>
a cover that surrounds the turntable and rests on that stand<br>
rather than the included cover that couples to the plinth.<br>
That sort of cover is seemingly wanted for most turntables lacking decoupling between platter and plinth...<br>
These direct-drive "DJ" turntables are about 450x350mm,<br>
while e.g. Thorens TD 160 plinth are about 480x390mm;<br>
if covers of about TD 160 size were available at reasonable cost,<br>
then one could construct an open-top box about 100mm high<br>
in which to set a "DJ" table and e.g. attach Thorens cover hinges to the box.
