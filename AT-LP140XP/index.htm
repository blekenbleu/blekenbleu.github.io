<h3>AT-LP140XP microphonics, mats, covers</h3>
<h4>nonslip mat</h4>
Seemingly, primary motivations for felt mats are reduced cost and facilitating DJ pitch bending and slip cueing.<br>
On the other hand, my turntable mat wish list includes:
<ul compact>
<li>good grip - speed stability cannot be ideal with slipping LPs
<li>more thickness - 1.5mm felt mat provided e.g. with AT-LP140BX<br>
 wants vertical tracking angle at or below adjustment lower limit
<li>minimize dirt and damage - felt attracts dirt and is hard to clean
<li>LP disc vibration attenuation - including immediate reactions to needle tracing<br>
 and ambient e.g. feedback from loudspeakers
</ul>
<p>
While I eventually intend to measure frequency response sweeps from test records with different mats,<br>
 initial measurements are phono signals from a needle resting half-way thru an idle LP stimulated by loudspeaker frequency sweeps.<br>
These measurements are confounded by loudspeaker response, room resonances, turntable platform rigidity and chassis isolation,<br> so <em>only interesting for <b>changes</b> in response</em>.
</p><p>
In this case, the turntable platform is 20mm MDF standing on concrete slab with engineered flooring, so minimal "trampoline effects".<br>
Unlike traditional (e.g. belt-drive) turntables,<br>
which typically have flat platter surfaces with LP contact determined by rubber mat ridges,<br>
the AT-LP140BX platter has an edge lip with an abrupt surface recess reducing gradually towards the center,<br>
so that support for flat LPs is only at edge and label even with a clamp.<br>
Consequently, LP grooves in between are are free to respond as diaphragms.<br>
Custom molded or highly resilient mats could fill that gap,
but (unless ribbed) risk driving mat debris into underside LP grooves.<br>
</p><p>
As an expedient spacer for provided 1.5mm felt, a 295mm diameter mat was cut from tool box liner:<br>
<img src="ToolMat.jpg"><br clear=all>.. which raises LPs 3mm.
</p><p>
Using REW (Room EQ Wizard),
felt pad cartridge signal measurements of loudspeaker sweeps indicate that<br>
microphonics are generally comparable with cover down or removed,
with most differences below 350Hz:<br>
<img src="closed_removed.png"><br clear=all>
Sharp nulls suggest mechanically conducted vibration into platter from base cancelling
airborne energy into LP.
</p><p>
The extent to which acoustic energy travels up from stand through feet and chassis vs cover effectiveness,<br>
despite mechanical coupling of cover to plinth to platter, remains to be determined.<br>
However, sharp nulls suggest that they are comparable.
</p><p>
Similarly, benefits of mat isolating LPs from energy conducted into platter
vs damping LP vibrations by mat and platter area work items.<br>
Here are some evidence from REQ (Room EQ Wizard):<br>
<img src="felt_tool_mat.jpg"><br clear=all>
Trace 3 averages 1 and 2, which are of provided felt mat over tool mat.<br>
The orange trace of tool mat and green trace of felt mat indicate that<br>
more is generally better, but dip around 5.5Hz for felt and 12Hz for tool mat may be meaningful.<br>
The 12Hz dip may be cancellation broadened by tool mat damping,
but the 5.5Hz dip looks like a resonance.<br>
By analogy with electronics, we know that there are two kinds of resonance: high impedance for parallel and low impedance for serial.<br>
Felt may present a high impedance resonance @ ~5.5Hz to energy from platter,<br>
while tool mat may present a high impedance @ ~12Hz,<br>
but it seems more likely IMO that mats instead present low impedance (sinking acoustic energy from LP to platter) at resonances.<br>
</p><p>
Here is more evidence:<br>
<img src="both.jpg"><br clear=all>
This compares felt over tool mat vs tool over felt, so arguably the same series impedance between platter and LP,<br>
 but note dips at both ~ 6 and 11Hz,<br>
which suggest that the tool pad couples better to the LP, supposing that energy is being sinked from LP to platter.<br>
<h4>Aftermarket cover?</h4>
For clarity and before evaluating traditional mat alternatives,<br>
measurements are wanted with more inert turntable stand and<br>
a cover that surrounds the turntable and rests on that stand<br>
rather than the included cover that couples to the plinth.<br>
That sort of cover is seemingly wanted for most turntables lacking decoupling between platter and plinth...<br>
These direct-drive "DJ" turntables are about 450x350mm,<br>
while e.g. Thorens TD 160 plinth are about 480x390mm;<br>
if covers of about TD 160 size were available at reasonable cost,<br>
then one could construct an open-top box about 100mm high<br>
in which to set a "DJ" table and e.g. attach Thorens cover hinges to the box.

<h4 id="sprung">Spring Suspension</h4>
I would rather have a semi-automatic direct drive with spring suspension,
which would have required getting lucky with an eBay Technics SL-1700MK2.<br>
Instead, this Audio Technica has M6x2.0 threaded feet, so insert springs between them and the plinth.<br>
Removing them and installing nuts threaded down to expose about 1/4 inch to engage the small end of these $8 conical springs from Amazon:<p>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0085YV9YE"><img align=left src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51WhxdzPULL._SY90_.jpg"></a> <img src="sprung.png"></p>
Slightly taller and stiffer would be better...<br>
Then, using a hole saw to cut four 2.25 inch diameter pucks from 3/8" plywood<br>
with 1/8" deep spring pockets created using a 3/4" spade bit<br>
and a 3/8" center bore to locate the conical spring upper ends
in the turntable feet pockets. <br>

<h4 id="lift">Tonearm Lift</h4>
If not semi-automatic, then at least tonearm lift at runout is wanted.<br>  The Q UP lift on my Thorens was much less expensive back in the day,<br>
and no commercially available lift fits the AT-LP140XP or other DJ style tables.<br>
Fortunately, the AT-LP140XP has a steel deck, so a lift can be located using
magnetic squares.<p>  Flat head screws are hot-glued to a pair of those squares,<br>
<img src="HotGlue.jpg"><br clear=all>
and a pair of nuts on each screw anchor either end of about 7 inches of 14AWG copper wire.</p>
Another 2 inches of wire are wrapped and soldered at right angle about 2.25 inches from one end.<br>  A pendulum is wrapped around one bent arm of that cross piece,<br>
with enough random nuts hot-glued to one end of the pendulum that just overbalances the tonearm at the other end.<br> 
<img src="pendulum.jpg" align=left><br clear=all>
<p>
The other cross piece arm is bent to hold the pendulum's weighted end just over center,<br>
<img src="Armed.jpg"><br clear=all>
so that the tonearm can easily topple it:<br>
