<h3 id="mat">nonslip mat</h3>
Seemingly, primary motivations for felt mats are reduced cost and facilitating DJ pitch bending and slip cueing.<br>
Instead, my platter mat wish list includes:
<ul compact>
<li>good grip - speed stability cannot be ideal with slipping LPs
<li>more thickness - 1.5mm felt mat provided e.g. with AT-LP140BX<br>
 wants vertical tracking angle at or below adjustment lower limit
<li>minimize dirt and damage - felt attracts dirt and is hard to clean
<li>vibration attenuation - including immediate reactions to needle tracing<br>
 and ambient e.g. feedback from loudspeakers
</ul>
<p>
While I eventually intend to measure frequency response sweeps from test records with different mats,<br>
 initial measurements are phono signals from a needle resting half-way thru an idle LP stimulated by loudspeaker frequency sweeps.<br>
These measurements are confounded by loudspeaker response, room resonances, turntable stand rigidity and chassis isolation,<br> so <em>only interesting for <b>changes</b> in response</em>.
</p><p>
In this case, the turntable stand is 20mm MDF on engineered flooring over concrete slab, so minimal "trampoline effects".<br>
Unlike traditional (e.g. belt-drive) turntables,<br>
which typically have flat platter surfaces with LP contact determined by rubber mat ridges,<br>
the AT-LP140BX platter has an edge lip with an abrupt surface recess reducing gradually towards the center,<br>
so that support for flat LPs is only at edge and label even with a clamp.<br>
Consequently, LP grooves in between are are free to respond as diaphragms.<br>
Custom molded or highly resilient mats could fill that gap,
but (unless ribbed) risk driving mat debris into underside LP grooves.<br>
</p><p>
As an expedient spacer for provided 1.5mm felt, a 295mm diameter mat was cut from tool box liner:<br>
<img src="ToolMat.jpg"><br clear=all>.. which raised LPs 3mm.
</p><p>
<h3 id="plots">microphonics</h3>
Using REW (Room EQ Wizard),
felt pad cartridge signal measurements of loudspeaker sweeps indicate that<br>
microphonics are generally comparable with cover down or removed,
with most differences below 350Hz:<br>
<img src="closed_removed.png"><br clear=all>
Sharp nulls suggest mechanically conducted vibration into platter from base cancelling
airborne energy into LP.
</p><p>
The extent to which acoustic energy travels up from stand through feet and chassis vs cover effectiveness,<br>
despite mechanical coupling of cover to plinth to platter, remains to be determined.<br>
However, sharp nulls suggest that they are comparable.
</p><p>
Similarly, benefits of mat isolating LPs from energy conducted into platter
vs damping LP vibrations by mat and platter area work items.<br>
Here are some evidence from REQ (Room EQ Wizard):<br>
<img src="felt_tool_mat.jpg"><br clear=all>
Trace 3 averages 1 and 2, which are of provided felt mat over tool mat.<br>
The orange trace of tool mat and green trace of felt mat indicate that<br>
more is generally better, but dip around 5.5Hz for felt and 12Hz for tool mat may be meaningful.<br>
The 12Hz dip may be cancellation broadened by tool mat damping,
but the 5.5Hz dip looks like a resonance.<br>
By analogy with electronics, we know that there are two kinds of resonance: high impedance for parallel and low impedance for serial.<br>
Felt may present a high impedance resonance @ ~5.5Hz to energy from platter,<br>
while tool mat may present a high impedance @ ~12Hz,<br>
but it seems more likely IMO that mats instead present low impedance (sinking acoustic energy from LP to platter) at resonances.<br>
</p><p>
Here is more evidence:<br>
<img src="both.jpg"><br clear=all>
This compares felt over tool mat vs tool over felt, so arguably the same series impedance between platter and LP,<br>
 but note dips at both ~ 6 and 11Hz,<br>
which suggest that the tool pad couples better to the LP, supposing that energy is being sinked from LP to platter.<br>
<h3 id="cover">Aftermarket cover?</h3>
For clarity and before evaluating traditional mat alternatives,<br>
measurements are wanted with better isolation, perhaps including<br>
a cover that surrounds the turntable, not resting on the deck<br>
rather than the included cover that couples to the plinth.<br>
That sort of cover is seemingly wanted for most turntables lacking decoupling between platter and plinth...<br>
These direct-drive "DJ" turntables are about 450x350mm,<br>
while e.g. Thorens TD 160 plinth are about 480x390mm;<br>
if covers of about TD 160 size were available at reasonable cost,<br>
then one could construct an open-top box about 100mm high<br>
in which to set a sprung turntable and e.g. attach Thorens cover hinges to that box.

<h3 id="sprung">Spring Suspension</h3>
I would prefer a semi-automatic direct drive with spring suspension,
but that wants getting lucky e.g. finding a Technics SL-1700MK2.<br>
Instead, this Audio Technica has M6x2.0 threaded feet, so inserted springs between them and its plinth.<br>
Installing nuts threaded down to expose about 1/4 inch locates small ends of $8 conical springs from Amazon:<p>

Taller and softer springs would be better...<br>
A hole saw cut four 2.25 inch diameter pucks from 3/8" plywood that fit plinth feet pockets,<br>
with 1/8" deep spring pockets made by a 3/4" spade bit<br>
and a 3/8" center bore to clear threaded feet ends.

<h3 id="lift">Tonearm Lift</h3>
If not semi-automatic, then at least tonearm lift at runout is wanted.<br>  The Q UP lift on my Thorens was much less expensive back in the day,<br>
and no commercially available lift fits an AT-LP140XP or other DJ style turntables.<br>
The AT-LP140XP has a steel deck, so a lift can be located by

magnetic squares.
<p>  Flat head screws are hot-glued to a pair of those squares,<br>
<img src="HotGlue.jpg"><br clear=all>
and a pair of nuts on each screw anchor either end of about 7 inches of 14AWG copper wire.</p>
<p>Another 2 inches of wire are wrapped and soldered at right angle about 2.25 inches from one end.<br>  A pendulum is wrapped around one bent arm of that cross piece,<br>
with enough random nuts hot-glued at one pendulum end to just overbalance the tonearm at the other end.<br> 
<img src="pendulum.jpg" align=left><br clear=all>
</p><p>
The other cross piece arm is bent to hold the pendulum's weighted end just over center,<br>
<img src="Armed.jpg"><br clear=all>
so that the tonearm can easily topple it:<br>

<h3 id="sprung2">Spring Suspension MKII</h3>
Springs from McMaster-Carr: <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/1692k42"><img align=top src="BigSprings.jpg"></a><br clear=all>
Their spring rate is spec'd at less than half that of relatively tiny springs from Amazon,
which were probably overrated.<br>
Upper spring seats are old Pioneer PL-950 feet.<br>
Increased spring travel has no benefit in this application,<br>
but the LP140XP is now much less affected by side impacts to its stand.<br>
Springs could be still softer e.g. 5 instead of 6.5 lb/in: <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/1692k4">https://www.mcmaster.com/1692k4</a>
<br>Those would re-enable height adjustment by turning nuts on threaded feet<br>
 and further reduce plinth resonant frequency:<br>
