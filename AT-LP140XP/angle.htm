<h2>Phono stylus rake and (cantilever) vertical tracking angles</h2>
<h3>frequency response</h3>
Sampling shorter sections of record grooves will recover more high frequency information.<br>
Sections sampled are shorter by <a href="https://www.sound-smith.com/articles/stylus-shape-information">elliptical AKA biradial than conical AKA spherical</a> styli.<br>
To reduce wear and pressure, micro-ridge styli elongate contact area along an axis <i>nearly</i> normal to disc plane and groove direction.<br>
The <i>nearly</i> arises because records are cut with on average 92 (rather than 90) degree stylus rake angle.<br>
To maintain effectively shortest sampling sections, micro-ridge styli should be aligned to match record lathe cutters.
<h3>alignment</h3>
Practically, few audiophiles have access to equipment for precisely measuring so-called rake angle of a micro-ridge stylus.<br>
Some users may measure stylus shank angle and suppose that working stylus shapes are ground with ridges parallel to shanks,</br>
despite no known (to me) documentation from manufacturers explicitly supporting that supposition.<br>
However, (cantilever) vertical tracking angles are commonly specified and relatively easy to measure.<br>
In theory, styli can be aligned by adjusting for strongest signal response to high frequency groove modulations.<br>
Using a personal computer, free software and audio interface,<br>
many users could also in theory make such high frequency response measurements.<br>
<p>
Practically, many turntables lack convenient adjustments for vertical tracking angles.<br>
Consequently, optically measuring vertical tracking angle before attempting tweaking based on audio signals<br>
is likely to expedite approaching optimal alignment.  While this depends on manufactures mounting styli<br>
with rake angle correctly fixed relative to specified cantilever angle, it is at least a good place to start<br>
any subsequent tweaks based on LP playback.

<h3>Analog Planet and USB microscopes</h3>
<a href="https://www.analogplanet.com/content/how-use-usb-digital-microscope-set-92-degree-stylus-rake-angle-sra">Michael Fremer's article</a>
motivated measuring stylus rake angle.<br>
Instead of his $249 Dino-Lite, I used a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06WD843ZM">$25 generic USB microscope</a>.<br>
<p>
This device was plug and play on macOS High Sierra<br>
and works on Windows 10 with an automatically installed Microsoft device driver,<br>
<img src="USB2UVCdriver.gif"><br clear=all>
</p><p>
but I had to disable the camera built into a monitor
before Microsoft's free Camera app would use the USB microscope.

</p><p>
While Mr. Fremer invested in a better desk stand,
I steadied the USB microscope near the stylus by resting it on an Pink Pearl eraser.
<br><img src="PinkPearl.jpg"><br clear=all>
</p><p>
Instead of using the microscope's built-in light,<br>
back-lighting a folded paper resting on the record behind the tonearm gave better results.<br>
To minimize distortion of angles in video,
aim the microscope square to the side of the cartridge<br>
and parallel to the record surface,

</p><p>
Instead of trying to capture a still image in focus,<br>
I recorded video while slowly moving the camera thru focus a few times,<br>
<img src="CameraApp.jpg"><br clear=all>
</p><p>
then stepped thru video playback
to an in-focus frame and captured a still by [Ctrl]+[Print Screen] 
<br><img src="MicroCameraPrtScr.jpg"><br clear=all>
</p><p>
and pasted that into <a href="https://www.irfanview.com/">Irfanview</a>,
which is free and handy for this purpose because of an option to precisely rotate images.
<br><img src="FineRot.jpg"><br clear=all>
</p><p>
Dragging a mouse cursor over an image in Irfanview generates a box for cropping<br>
and/or for vertical and horizontal references to features in those images.
<br><img src="CropBox.jpg"><br clear=all>
</p><p>
A first rotation makes the record surface horizontal.<br>
Crop and save that image, then use it to measure stylus and cantilever angles.

</p><p>
With AT-LP140ZP tonearm base cranked all the way down,<br>
cantilever angle measured about 26.5 for a record on a 2.5mm platter mat.<br>
7mm total mat thickness yielded 21 degree VTA,<br>so
4.5mm mat (or tonearm height) change corresponds to 5.5 degree change.<br>

</p><p>
A-T VM95ML microline is visibly uncentered in stylus shank;<br>
only A-T knows whether their microlines are ground exactly parallel to shanks..<br>
Meanwhile, A-T specifies a (23 degree) cantilever vertical tracking angle,<br>
which is easier to measure and set as a starting point for any subsequent audio evaluation.
