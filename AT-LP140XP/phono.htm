<title>Phono MM input capacitance</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>stylus resonance</h2>
Moving magnet phonograph cartridges are substantially inductive,<br>
and moving magnet (MM) phonograph amplifier input stages have capacitance,<br>
often over 100pF, typically in parallel with 47K Ohms.<br>
That combination will resonate, and that resonance is typically wanted
well above audibility i.e. &gt 20 KHz.<br>
Audio-Technica has been making phono cartridges since 1962.<br>
While they also make moving coil cartridges, their line of moving magnet cartridges and styli is extensive.<br>
Their MicroLine styli are well-regarded, but some Audio-Technica moving magnet cartridges
are reputed to have relatively boosted high-frequency response,<br>
which has been attributed resonance with typical capacitive loadings.
Rated 550mH inducance and 200pF resonate at ~ 480kHz,<br>
but phono cartridges are generators with cantilever armatures,<br>
so electro-mechanical resonances are at issue.<br>
Reducing input capacitance can mitigate audible brightness by raising resonant frequencies beyond audibility.<br>
Some MM stages offer multiple loading options for resistance and/or capacitance.  <br>

<h3>cables</h3>
At audio frequencies, short (e.g. 1 meter) shielded coaxial cables do not exhibit classical transmission line behavior.<br>
Instead, they are mostly capacitive, which can be problematic at typical MM phono impedances.<br>
<br>

<h3>MM input stages</h3>
MM phono cartridges typically generate 4 mV.<br>
Tandberg 3002 MM 1mV sensitivity for 0.5V output, with 290mV maximum.<br>
For 10kHz-5MHz sweeps, nanoVNA delivers about 370mV peak-to-peak into 47k Ohms<br>
or about 185mV RMS, so unlikely to damage MM phono inputs.<br>
<br>
For CH0 Smith display, nanoVNA directly reports capacitance or inductance:<br>
* 8.5pF for the disconnected BNC Tee<br>
* 18.5pF for BNC Tee connected to oscilloscope input rated 13pF<br>
* 63.5pF with Tee and unterminated 2ft coax<br>
* 79pF when connected to the oscilloscope and 2ft BNC coax unterminated<br>
* 82.5 when connected to the oscilloscope and 2ft coax with phono plug adapter<br>
* 463pF when that Tee is connected to a 2ft coax terminated in 390pF +/-5%<br>
* 479pF when also connected to the oscilloscope<br>
Consequently, we suppose that 2ft coax contributes approx 55 - 65pF.<br>
<br>
Replacing that 390pF capacitor with Tandberg 3002 MM input<pre>
   Left Right channel
* 103pF 101pF when 20pF selected on Tandberg
* 194pF 187pF when 120pF selected on Tandberg
* 401pF 376pF when 350pF selected on Tandberg</pre>

Since Audio-Technical typically recommends 100-200pF load capacitance,<br>
Tandberg's 120pF selection would be best for this cable...<br>
But we will not be using 2 ft BNC cables with the phonograph,<br>
which tonearm wiring will also add capacitance.<br>
Fortunately, RG-59/U coax are available with RCA connectors...
