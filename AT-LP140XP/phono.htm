<h3>resonance</h3>
Moving magnet phonograph cartridges are substantially inductive,
and moving magnet (MM) phonograph amplifier input stages have capacitance,
often over 100pF, typically in parallel with 47K Ohms.
That combination will resonate, and that resonance is typically wanted
well above audibility e.g. > 20 KHz.
Audio-Technica has been making phono cartridges since 1962, and while they
also make moving coil cartridges, they make an extensive line of moving magnet cartridges and styli.
While their MicroLine styli are well-regarded,  some Audio-Technica moving magnet cartridges
are considered to have boosted high-frequency response, which is attributed to inductance (e.g. 460-550mH) higher
than in otherwise comparable cartridges, which can provoke more audible resonance.
550mH and 200pF resonates at ~ 480kHz, but phono cartridges are generators with armatures,
so electro-mechanical resonances are at issue.
Reducing input capacitance can mitigate this.  Some MM stages offer multiple loading options,
more typically for resistances than capacitance.  

<h3>cables</h3>
At audio frequencies, short (e.g. 1 meter) shielded coaxial cables do not exhibit classical transmission line behavior.
Instead, they mostly exhibit capacitance, particularly into typical MM phono preamp input loads.


MM phono cartridges typically generate 4-
MM input stages
Tandberg 3002 MM 1mV sensitivity for 0.5V output, with 290mV maximum.
For 10kHz-5MHz sweeps, nanoVNA delivers about 370mV peak-to-peak into 47k Ohms
or about 185mV RMS, so unlikely to damage MM phono inputs.

For CH0 Smith display, nanoVNA directly reports capacitance or inductance:
* 8.5pF for the disconnected BNC Tee
* 18.5pF for BNC Tee connected to oscilloscope input rated 13pF
* 63.5pF with Tee and unterminated 2ft coax
* 79pF when connected to the oscilloscope and 2ft BNC coax unterminated
* 82.5 when connected to the oscilloscope and 2ft coax with phono plug adapter
* 463pF when that Tee is connected to a 2ft coax terminated in 390pF +/-5%
* 479pF when also connected to the oscilloscope
Consequently, we suppose that 2ft coax contributes approx 55 - 65pF.

Replacing that 390pF capacitor with Tandberg 3002 MM input
   Left Right channel
* 103pF 101pF when 20pF selected on Tandberg
* 194pF 187pF when 120pF selected on Tandberg
* 401pF 376pF when 350pF selected on Tandberg

Since Audio-Technical typically recommends 100-200pF load capacitance,
Tandberg's 120pF selection would be best for this cable...
But we will not be using 2ft BNC cables with the phonograph,
which tonearm wirig will also add capacitance
