<li>relatively quiet and effective
<li>relatively high initial, but lower operating expense<br> (replacement media replacement interval vs cost)</ul>

<dt><br><a href=https://rgf.com/products/air/halo-led-whole-home-in-duct-air-purifier/><b>RGF REME HALO-LED</b> HVAC air cleaner</a>
<dd>UV LED generates ionized hydrogen peroxide vapor without ozone,<br>
which <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7132689/">disinfects</a> and improves Filtrete effectiveness:
<ul><li>Our HVAC has <a href="https://filterstudy.com/3m-filtrete-mpr-2200-ultrafine-particle-reduction-air-filter/">Filtrete MPR 2200 media</a>, because cheaper than MPR 1900
<li><a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/appliances/air-filters/best-air-filters-for-furnace-and-central-ac-a7407356325/">Consumer Reports rated Filtrete MPR 1900 better</a> than alternatives<br> rated less than MERV 13,
because more pleats present less airflow resistance.
<li>Filtretes replaced monthly are darker after RGF REME HALO installation or replacement.
</ul>
<dd><br>Original HALO cell employs a fluorescent UV lamp<br>
 that runs continuously and needs replacing every 2 years or so.<br>
The original HALO with cell cost $392<br>
Replacement cells cost $180 in Jan 2022 and $190 today.<br>
Total parts cost for 10 years might be about $1100.<br>

<dd><br>HALO-LED cells want replacing after 5 years, costing $225-290 on ebay.<br>
Wiring must be changed to run LED only with air handler blower.<br>
<a href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09LJ21942>Amazon currently has HALO-LED units for $440</a>,<br>
for a 10-year cost of ~$700.<br>
That Amazon unit price is suspiciously less than elsewhere,<br>
but received HALO-LED carton was sealed and appears genuine.<br>

<dd><br>While both REME HALO external appearances are very similar,<br>
original HALO's arrowhead-shaped housing points UP on supply plenum wall;<br>
HALO-LED unit wants housing instead pointing LEFT, sigh...<br>

<dd><br>LED cell replacement appears slightly more finicky than fluorescent,<br>
might be daunting in another 5 years, 8 feet up on a ladder.<br>

<dt><br><b>REME - concluding episode</b></a>
<dd>In fact, original and LED HALO shapes are <i>identical</i> and use identical packaging.
<ul><li> Both include 24V transformers with identical ratings...<br>
   ... but different connectors presumably discourage connecting<br>
     always-on power for fluorescent HALO to only-with-fan HALO-LED.
<li> arguably the most striking external difference is operating LED
    <ul><li>original HALO had a bright red LED that lit up that corner of the garage
    <li>HALO-LED has a dim green LED facing the wall<br>
      that can barely be seen in the dark at night,<br>
      mostly overwhelmed by light from a nearby dehumidifier.
</ul></ul>
<dd><br>Hole in plenum wall for HALO-LED needed to be wider<br>
than for the original;  some hacking required:<br>
<img src=hack.jpg>
<dd><br>RGF included a template for the hole shape,<br>
but I had to cut the outer flange shape:<br>
<img src=template.jpg><br>
Threaded stud at upper left was for a dead air purifier that came with the house.<br>
Another stud cut off by Dremel tool made space for this template.<br><br>

Shiny new HALO-LED in crummy old plenum:<br>

<dd><br>Air handler blower is powered differently for heat and cool,<br>
but circuit board 110VAC connections for electronic air cleaner work fine.
