Wave Corrector PE v3.7 and SE v1.4 have now been released. The following features are new in these versions:
Support for FLAC format files is now built in.
The program now processes all non-standard tags found in FLAC input files.
Re-sampling is now supported using algorithms by Naoki Shibata (ssrc).
Multitrack files can now be normalised on a per track basis.
Program settings can now be saved to file (PE only).
Batch settings (PE only) and Save settings can now be optionally saved between sessions .
The program now handles multiple session files with different names (PE only).
The scale in the main window can now optionally show track timings (PE only).

<dt><b>Recording vinyl - wet or dry? Thu Sep 08, 2005 5:21 am</b><dd>
Handbook for Sound Engineers; 1st edition 1987; Howard W. Sams & Company:
 During normal playback the friction between the diamond and the vinyl
raises the temperature at the contact point to roughly 500 F*.
As incredible as this seems, it is necessary to preserve the record
as the heat literally melts the plastic whilst burning off corbon molecules in the stylus.
The melting of the surface is what gives the vinyl the ability to yield under the tremendous forces exerted by the stylus.
By using water as a coolant, the temperature is lowered to the point where the carbon is no longer burned off,
resulting in a longer stylus life; but the vinyl can no longer yield,
and the groove wall is scraped away by the diamond instead.
Regardless of the solution you use, wet playback is a one way street for the record.

<dt><b>Clicks versus LP Condition Thu Jan 13, 2005 8:14 pm</b><dd>
I am also fairly new, and have processed about 30 LPs.
The lowest number of clicks I have logged on one side of an LP recording is about 3,000,
using level 3 as the default click sensitivity setting. These albums are almost in mint condition.
I don't have any fancy cleaning solutions, just a the standard velvet cloth.

Here's my take on clicks/album side versus the condition of the LP.
Less than 3,000: Mint LP
Less than 5,000: Almost mint. Has been played a few times and has been well looked after.
Around 10,000; Above average. The copy has been played a number of times on a quality turntable and has been taken care of.
Up to 20,000; Average. This copy has seen had a lot of play, but still produces respectible results after correction.
Over 25,000; Below average to poor. The copy is not only dirty, but is also worn. This is below my tolerance.
If the source is rare I will continue. However, if it is still available I'll capitulate and purchase a commerical CD.

I use click-detection setting of 2, and then super-scan at the same setting three times.
This usually gets me down to fewer than 20 clicks on the final pass.
I find (this is my personal opinion) this method to give better results than a single pass at a higher setting.

I generally scan at 2 when I open a file (generally less than 100 clicks)
then delete any false detections at the 2 level
(which can be more than half of total clicks when harps, cymbals, or loud brass are present)
then block scan at level 3 for long periods where only strings or low volume (or less transient material) is present.
Then I manually delete any remaining clicks that are audible (usually only one to five).
I've oly done one rock album, but with there louder recorded levels a setting of 2 might be just right except between tracks.

I find the 3-setting to give some false positives on the highest piano notes. Drum-brush accompaniment can also be tricky.
But at 2-setting I find that most false positives (unless there are a lot bunched close together)
don't result in any audible artefacts, at least to my old ears, so I usually don't bother deleting them.

<dt><b>End of songs getting chopped off Mon Jan 28, 2013 6:44 pm</b><dd>
&gt; If a track ends prematurely, it should be possible to drag the track boundary (with the mouse) to the correct position.
I've sorted it now - before I was trying to move the black markers (in track view)
rather than selecting the edge of the black area that appears when you select End Of Track in the corrections list.

<dt><b>24/96 Recording - seem to get some distortion Wed May 05, 2010 1:47 am</b><dd>
For records that are in decent condition I use the level 1 setting; minimum size=7; noise discrimination=0, and the AGC=3.
With these settings the number of corrections is limited to 500~1000 in most cases.
With this small number, I'll scroll through the correction list one-by-one to move through the file and make adjustments.
In most cases, all that remains is clean music, with a very fine, barely audible crackle that's easily ignored.

I assume everyone has carefully checked input/output levels on their cards/mixers.
On my M-Audio 2496, I get some peak noise if I approach 0 decibels even if WC is recording in a normal range. 

<dt><b>Sun Sep 04, 2011 5:08 pm</b><dd>
When the program is in 'track boundary' view (the track view with the boundary/fade setting capabilities),
the user is unable to switch back to 'wave' view without first moving away from the track boundaries.

<dt><b>Repeating clicks Sun Mar 06, 2011 10:27 pm</b><dd>
If the clicks are very bad you'll need to manually edit them.
There's the 'Find...' command on the Corrections menu that helps with this.
Select one of the repeating clicks, and then under 'Find' select 'Timed Jump'
and select 33, 45, or 78 to jump forward (or back) to the next click in the sequence.

<dt><b>Trouble Adding Cue Markers Mon Jul 20, 2009 4:43 pm</b><dd>
&gt; When I'm working to narrow in on a 'click' that the program didn't eliminate automatically,
&gt; I sometimes find myself unable to add cue markers
&gt; -- neither the TAB key or the 'Corrections - Insert Cue' menu pulldown will add one.

I see that there is a restriction that prevents a cue marker being placed within about 250ms of the previous marker.
Once you're in the vicinity of the click, the idea is to find it by observation of the waveform and/or the spectrogram.
When you think you've found it, a very good way to confirm it is to
mark a block over the click in the waveform and then use 'Audition Corrected'.
This plays the waveform, skipping over the marked block.

Just keep repositioning/narrowing the block 'till it's a hair width - there you'll find the troublemaker.
Sometimes it's the only way to find/correct those well masked gremlins.

<dt><b>Cut and Splice op Tue Jul 21, 2009 1:45 pm</b><dd>
splice length is exactly analogous to the length of the diagonal cut that you make when you splice an analogue tape
AKA cross-fade

<dt><b>Over correction Mon Feb 09, 2009 4:52 pm</b><dd>
&gt; The ones that most need improvement are those which have over corrected and cause an effect like a tape drop-out.
&gt; All such a correction usually needs is to contract its width a tad.
&gt; Occasionally the effect seems to be caused by inaccurate placement
&gt; and deleting it and re-inserting at the apex of the click sorts it out.

If you look in Auto-Scan Options and click the Advanced button, you can set the Correction Width to Narrow.
This should overcome the problem, although you may end up with a similar number of under-corrected clicks.

<dt><b>Signature Trace redlines Wed Sep 06, 2006 12:52 am</b><dd>
&gt; I dug out one of my old Santana LPs (Cravansarei <sp>) the other day to transcribe.
&gt; The opening track of the second side has an intro of some minutes of bongos, congas, etc.
&gt; The poor old correction signature traces maxes out when it hits this section!
&gt; There are a few geniune pops in the recording but most of it is obviously false positives.
&gt; While to my untutored ear there doesn't appear to be any degradation in the sound
&gt; I'm wondering (in principal) what is the best way to fix this.

Mark the section as a block (the easiest way to do this is to drag in the overview window);
Then use the Block - ReScan Clicks command and set lower threshold.
You may find that with the lower threshold, some genuine clicks are missed.
In this case, you'll need to zoom in to them and rescan just in their vicinity at a higher threshold.
Or if there are only one or two of them, you could simply insert manual corrections over them.

<dt><b>Track Splitting Mon Oct 10, 2005 6:43 pm</b><dd>
'Play Corrected' plays over gaps between tracks, but audio is muted during these periods.
To audition the start and end of tracks, use the Audition Track Boundary button after selecting the boundary you want to hear.

<dt><b>AGC settings Wed Sep 28, 2005 6:43 am</b><dd>
Click detection works on relative levels rather than absolute.
Because click detection works on relative amplitudes,
it is an inherent characteristic of the click detector that clicks have to be louder during loud passages in order to be detected.
The AGC setting exaggerates this effect according to the setting you choose.

<dt><b>splice length options Sun Sep 18, 2011 6:35 pm</b><dd>
&gt; one must invoke the cut and splice command in order to make any changes to the splice length.
&gt; the programme has the ability to audition the usefulness of making a cut before actually invoking the dialogue

it does now take an extra mouse click to change the splice length

<dt><b>Thu Sep 15, 2011 4:10 pm</b><dd>
The 'show track times' option on the view menu should be active whenever the 'scale' option is checked.
