<h3><a href=AudioTechnica.htm>Audio-Technica</a> (P-mount) ATN81CP Replacement Stylus</h3>
<a href="https://www.zzounds.com/item--AUTATN81CP">zZounds</a> still has <i>genuine</i> Audio-Technica ATN81CP replacement styli in stock.<br>
How their quality compares with aftermarket alternatives is unkown, but unlike some alternatives, the original includes a much appreciated stylus guard that works with the cartridge.<br>

<br clear=all>An inexpensive conical stylus is unlikely to be well polished and may sound better<br> after some bedding in.  Such styli may also better tolerate less than ideal alignment.  <br>
