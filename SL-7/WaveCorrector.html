There are some aspects of Wave Corrector behaviour that may have drawn you to an incorrect conclusion::(<br>
<i>For display and auditioning purposes</i>, Wave Corrector only uses 16-bit samples. In the case of a 24-bit file, it ignores the 8 least significant bits.<br>
 &nbsp This explains the -90 dB limit on the level meters and also why your auditioned audio wasn't as good as you expected it to be.<br>
However, this 16-bit limitation has no effect on the audio files produced by Wave Corrector.<br>
All filter calculations are done using 32-bit arithmetic and results saved as 16- or 24- bit depending on the sample depth of the file being processed.
