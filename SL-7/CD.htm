<h3>Perfect sound for never</h3>
When going back for my graduate degree, I left my record collection and Thorens TD-1126 II behind,<br>
instead taking a Magnavox FD1040:&nbsp <img src=images/FD1040.jpg><br clear=all>
It did not last long, being the first in my experience of electronic devices to fail from cheap electrolytic capacitors.
While not anticipating perfect sound from CDs, I did expect (and got)<ul compact>
<li>freedom from LP ticks and pops,
<li>less sibilance,
<li>less fumbling,
<li>higher storage density,
<li>playback in cars.
</ul>
With CD sound not completely disappointing, I did forfeit listening to most classical music and jazz,<br>
because violins and saxophones mostly sounded irritating on CDs.<br>
Being frugal, few CD purchases replaced LPs, and 40 years later,<br>
having already ripped most CDs to FLAC, I now intend to do the same for LPs.<br>
In addition to the tedium of LP cleaning,
one hurdle was dropping the needle in lead-in grooves.<br> Being clumsy has not improved with age...<br>
<br>With hindsight, I can appreciate that Technics' straight-line tracking direct drive T4P automatic turntables were superior to belt drive, random cartridges and SME fumbling,<br>
with T4P cartridge engineers able to concentrate on fixed known operating conditions.<br>
At this point, Audio-Technica is the primary source of T4P cartridges,
with GRADOs being somewhat heavier than specified 6 grams and wanting more than 1.5g tracking force.&nbsp
Even if a T4P Ortofon head is sourced, my understanding is that replacement OM-10/20/30 styli are lower compliance than originals designed for T4P.&nbsp
Meanwhile, Audio-Technica continues to manufacture low mass advanced styli <i>with fresh elastomers</i> that aftermarket firms
retrofit for AT3472 family cartridges.<br>
While others pay exhorbitant prices for NOS antique styli,
I put more trust in suspension elastomers which have not been stored in unknown conditions for decades.&nbsp
Re-tipping a worn stylus seems to me like putting new tires on a car with sagging springs, worn bushings and shock absorbers.<br>
An SL-7 is for me good-enough, with decent stability and rumble masked by record noise.
