<a name=sim><h2>Assetto Corsa, Content Manager and Custom Shading Patch settings</h2></a>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/244210/Assetto_Corsa/">Assetto Corsa</a> is a car racing game.&nbsp I own 2 others, but have so far driven only AC.<br>
This is partly because AC supports most of the cars and tracks that I care to drive,<br>
but also because game software is generally so idiosynchratic and poorly documented<br>
that learning to use them is for me more irritating than enjoyable.<br>
This is NOT to imply that AC is either well-documented or easy to use,<br>
simply that fighting more than one crappy software is gratuitously masochistic.<br>
Basic AC usage is described in around 50 of the 700 pages in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NS918M4">Going Nowhere Fast In Assetto Corsa</a>,<br>
 a Kindle ebook on Amazon. &nbsp
However, it is quite out-of-date
<br>
AC has been enhanced by so-called mods, many of which are free and add interesting cars and tracks.<br>
Other mods, notably Content Manager and Custom Shader Patch, affect AC operation.<br>
Exactly how CM and CSP work and what they do is similarly idiosynchratic and poorly documented.<br>
AC settings are stored in about 200 files in over 100 folders under ~/Documents/Assetto Corsa/.<br>
On a guess, Content Manager mostly works by altering those files before launching AC.<br>
On the other hand, CSP seems more about actually replacing and extending AC processing routines.<br>
Configuration files to control CSP are in <code>~\AppData\Local\AcTools Content Manager\Presets</code>.<br>
So far, the only configuration files there are <code>NeckFX</code> in <code>Custom Shaders Patch Presets</code>.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.nutrimatic.cc/assetto-corsa/reducing-or-changing-windscreen-dirt/">To just get rid of the dirt completely, use CSP’s WindscreenFX feature</a><br>
<br>
When migrating from Logitech G29 to AccuForce wheels,<br>
Assetto Corsa ignored the new wheel when launched from CM.<br>
Launched from Steam, AC would use the new wheel.  Launched from Sim Commander 4, CM did not launch CSP.<br>
Previously, some things did not work, depending on the sequence in which Windows Mixed Reality was launched<br>
relative to Steam, CM and AC.<br>
I have yet to sort a working configuration for WMR+SteamVR+SC4+CM+CSP+AC,<br>
but worked around the CM+AC+AccuForce issue by renaming ~/Documents/Assetto Corsa/ to ~/Documents/Assetto Corsa.br/<br>
then configuring AccuForce in CM and launching AC from there, creating a new ~/Documents/Assetto Corsa/<br>
which lacks all tweaks made in ~/Documents/Assetto Corsa.b4/ which has 96 files different from those in the new folder,<br>
based on WinMerge folder comparison. WinMerge external editor was changed to GVim.<br>
<br>
At least for the differences, I want to understand what the do and reapply as many as make sense.
