<h4>SimHub ShakeIt profile mechanics</h4>

 &emsp; <a href=../tires.htm><i>slip/grip for tire haptics</i></a><br><br>

Haptics here are about <i>driver aids</i>, rather than <i>immersion</i>.
<p>SimHub considers imported profiles as duplicates NOT based on name;<br>
enter <b>No</b> to have an imported profile considered unique.<br>
I contemplate only 8 haptic transducers and 8 haptic signals, 4 of which are wheel slip.<br>
Engine rumble on a dead pedal, where left foot is braced, except when declutching.<br>
</p>

<p>One reason for writing SimHub plugins instead of Custom Serial profiles is because<br>
C# software engineering is relatively painless using Visual Studio and GitHub Desktop;<br>
copying and pasting C# procedures among files and repositories is quite manageable,<br>
while swapping ShakeIt effects among profiles is exasperating.</p>

<p>SimHub ShakeIt updates now have JavaScript formulae being less expensive.<br>
<b>Run once javascript code</b> section supports precalculation and encourages modularity.</p>

<h4>SimHub ShakeIt Slip/Grip haptic discussion</h4>

<p>SimHub's ShakeIt CUSTOM effect Forced frequency enhancement<br>
 enables independent volume and frequency control.<br>
ShakeIt property values e.g. from <i>proxyS</i> are limited to 0-100 range.<br>
Early warning by haptics helps compensate for poor reflexes,<br>
with audible higher frequencies (approx 800Hz) tire squeal for slip onset warning.<br>
Lacking real life experience with formula cars,<br>
and with (too?) many years since driving dedicated sports racers,<br>
this feedback may lack credibility for drivers of those vehicles with treadless tires.<br>
If both audible or tactile onset are too soon, then reducing <i>proxyS</i> <b>Gain</b> may help.<br>
Otherwise, if tactile gets too strong too soon, consider increasing <i>noisy</i> <b>Gamma</b>.</p>

<p>SimHub Automatic calibration may not work well for WHEELS SLIP in AMS2.</p>

<p>My claim:&nbsp <i>ratio of tire slip to grip</i> is more useful feedback than <i>slip alone</i>.<br>
This ratio usefully modulates haptic frequency, but also mutes output when ratio is small.<br>
While discussing with @RangeyRover about a SimHub plugin for longitudinal acceleration<br>
it struck me that the key to loss of control is when grip stops increasing with tire slip;<br>
that ratio was simple and seemingly good enough.</p>

<h4>Grip and Load</h4>
<p>While SimHub provides slip, grip is more elusive.<br>
Being the ratio of combined lateral and longitudinal acceleration (surge + sway) to wheel load,<br>
wheel load is unavailable from most sims, but many provide suspension deflection telemetry.<br>
Heave is one component of wheel load, with pitch and yaw changes affecting its distribution.<br>

<h4>Haptics generation</h4>
<p>To break up forced frequency pure tones, add <code>rand()</code> amount proportional to frequency,<br>
e.g. <code>frequency + Math.rand()*frequency/3</code><br>
Minimum Hz >= 30Hz feels best for Dayton pucks.<br>
60Hz is too high for strongest sensations from pucks under thighs.<br>
Max Hz > 800Hz is preferred for approximating tire squeal heard with initial slip<br>
in BMWs driven for most recent > 5 years of track days.<br>
IMO, tire haptic frequency should vary continuously from high to low with increasing slip/grip.<br>
As fate would have it, puck haptics feel stronger as frequencies drop from around 150 to 30Hz;<br>
over 150Hz is mostly audible, as in real life.</p>

For tuning, one could create *tweak* custom effect property values, to be tweaked during playback,<br>
then modify *noisy* and *output* to calculate min and max Hz from those *tweak* property values.<br>

<h4>2D grip (acceleration) modulated by load</h4>
IMO, lateral and longitudinal values should be treated equivalently for both slip and grip.<br>
<code>GlobalAccelerationG</code> turns out to be just rescaled absolute <code>AccelerationSurge</code>,<br>
 &emsp; <i>not</i> what is wanted in ratio with 2D slip.<br>
Approximate integration confirms that positive heave acceleration is upward.<br>
In theory, maximum negative heave should be -1G.<br>
For slip/grip ratio, estimated grip values want square root of<br>
&nbsp sum of squares of suitably scaled Surge and Yaw accelerations.<br>
That 2D accel (estimated grip) value wants to be scaled by (1 + Heave) G's:<ul>
<li>no grip when Heave = -1G &emsp; // vehicle in free fall
<li>unity grip when Heave = 0
<li>increased grip when Heave > 0.</ul>
Thus:&nbsp <i>
a fixed amount of slip becomes more concerning as estimated grip decreases,<br>
 &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; risking loss of control...</i>

<h4>Shift haptic</h4>
Shift haptics was originally a one-off, not something I expected to use.<br>
Based on speed/rpm ratio, gated by property from SimHub SHIFT effect.<br>
Forced frequency based on rpm... &nbsp forced freq seemed constant,<br>
except for 4 corner effect; &nbsp a bug? &nbsp -&gt fixed!</p>

<p>For longitudinal slip and discounting gear shifts,<br>
changes to <code>GameData.Speed / GameData.Rpms</code> pretty well approximates longitudinal slip<br>
without needing to know wheel rps.  Sorting gear changes from other longitudinal slip<br>
uses logic based on SimHub's Gear Shift effect.<br>
This is doomed for cars with torque converters or continuously variable transmissions.</p>

<h4>Coding Methodology</h4><ol compact>
<li>ponder
<li>code
<li>test
<li>debug, loop to 1
<li>document, reviewing code and finding more bugs, loop to 1
<li>publish to GitHub
<li>collect feedback, loop to 1.</ol>

<h4>Wheel lock and force feedback vs tire lockup</h4>
<p>Wheel lock usually means the amount of available steering rotation<br>
 or how abruptly resistance increases at rotation limits.<br>
Based on slip, force feedback should decrease.<br>
  For example, losing control on ice, force feedback should basically disappear.<br>
I do not recall feeling much tire judder thru steering while cornering on track.<br>
On the other hand, locking up brakes could often create dramatic wheel judder.<br>
Similarly for too hard acceleration with limited slip differential on patchy damp pavement.</p>

<p>I used to get complaints from driving school instructors that my driving scared their students,<br>
but never crashed and was rarely passed when tracks were wet.<br>
My only high speed spins were on snow and ice;<br>
did a little ice racing in Canada with CASC during college.<br>
Being my own mechanic and usually driving to/from events discouraged overexuberance.<br>
My sports racer had more grip than I ever got comfortable exploiting.<br>
Nearly all my most recent track experience was in trailing arm BMWs, with plenty of oversteer.<br>
A couple of spins during autocross were too brief to sort.</p>

<p>In theory, spins happen when tires are well beyond peak grip,<br>
while most judder occurs while tires are near peak grip.<br>
With no off-road racing experience, I lack bases for judging haptics for e.g. EAWRC23.<br>
I suppose that aggressive use of hand brake affects things.
</p>

<p>Spin to me implies loss of yaw control, with tires past peak grip.<br>
Lock for wheels means wheel rotation stopped, usually because of excessive braking.<br>
On track, much slip is lateral, associated with change in direction, yaw times speed.<br>
Substantial (lateral) slip is possible with wheel speed equal to vehicle speed.<br>
Except when coasting, driving wheels must slip slightly to generate force for maintaining speed.</p>

<p>On track, one must learn to filter the overwhelming amount of inputs.<br>
Meanwhile, e.g. lack of G forces in sims is only partly compensated by harness tensioning,<br>
but I don't miss all the noise, windshield glare and expenses.</p>

<p>I am no athlete;  it took me multiple weekends on each track to usefully remember corners<br>
and skid pad sessions to sort car balance before having brain to spare<br>
for noticing what feedback was reliable and helpful for improving driving.<br>
Some other track junkies shared noticing how slowly and poorly I drove first sessions,<br>
despite being in the advanced driver group, then gradually improved over weekends.<br>
Car setup and practice were my compensations for lack of talent.</p>

<p>To improve steering feedback, I changed physical steering in real cars<br>
(smaller rims, faster ratios, less assist and more caster).<br>
That is one example of how sim wheels are unrealistic<br>
by offering better feedback than most real cars in my experience.<br>
In fact, my direct drive wheel base can deliver more feedback than I comfortably use,<br>
which is a key motivation for my haptics to offload information from the wheel.</p>

<p>I suppose that experience helps imagine what physics can subvert sim telemetry for feedbacks,<br>
but some of these feedbacks are more useful than realistic.<br>
I am impressed (but not surprised) by how fast some sim guys can be with only G27 or G29,<br>
because athletic skills and practice.&nbsp  Meanwhile, I want all the help that I can invent...</p>

<h4>Enhancements?</h4>
<ul><li>User interface for adjusting formulae "constants"
<li>separately loadable profile parameters - car / sim specific
<li>better understanding Automatic calibration
</ul>
