<h3>Tire haptics</h3>
Rolling tires <code>slip</code> while producing <code>grip</code>;&nbsp
there is a <a href="https://technicalf1explained.blogspot.com/2012/10/f1-tirespart-2.html">discussion</a> and here is a chart:<br>
<img width=800 src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_zjXCT8lH0U/UIWXEP8DnKI/AAAAAAAAARU/lrGi8Jgjq80/s1600/Slip+Angle+Graph.jpg"><br><br>

Normal driving on dry pavement rarely generates more than 0.5G,<br>
for which most tires develop <code>grip</code> nearly proportional to <code>slip</code>.<br>
The amount of <code>slip</code> varies with conditions and tire construction,<br>
but beyond some point, <code>slip</code> increases faster than <code>grip</code>, which eventually <i>decreases</i>.<br><br>
Tires audibly squeal as they begin to <code>slip</code> more than <code>grip</code>.<br>
As <code>slip</code> increases, tire squeals change to moans, then judders;<br>
in other words, the audible frequency <b>decreases</b> as <code>slip</code> <b>increases</b>.<br>

The amount of <code>slip</code> that is problematic varies among cars, tracks, sims and driving style.<br>
Worse, the amount of <code>slip</code> reported by game telemetry varies widely.<br>
However, the <i>ratio</i> of <code>slip</code> to <code>grip</code> is relatively constant for moderate <code>grip</code> levels,<br>
then increases more abruptly as tires approach their limits.<br>
Consequently, producing haptic feedback based on <code>slip/grip</code> works better than <code>slip</code> alone.<br>
Conveniently, haptic sensitivity also <b>increases</b> as frequency <b>decreases</b> e.g. from 600Hz to 30Hz.<br>
This encourages using (decreasing) frequency cues for (increasing) tire <code>slip/grip</code> haptics.

<h3>Loaded tire slip/grip</h3>
Completely unloaded tires generate no grip even when slip is massive.<br>
Rapid turns left provoke louder noises from right-side tires and vice versa.<br>
Similarly, front tires complain more loudly in panic stops.<br>
Consequently, tire haptic <code>intensity</code> should be modulated by tire <code>load</code>,<br>
helping sim drivers sort which tires are most stressed.
