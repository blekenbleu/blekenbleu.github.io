<h3>GT steering wheel without display for VR</h3>
Moving hands from steering wheel, even if only to shift, is mildly distracting;<br>
looking away from the road to locate and wrestle idiosynchratic controls is even moreso.<br>
In one sense, VR without passthrough avoids this, since real controls are invisible,<br>
but fumbling around to manipulate them only by feel is mostly doomed <b><i>for me</i></b>.<br>
Implicitly, displays on wheels are in VR wasted complexity, cost and mass.<br>

IMO, controls used while driving should be reachable
without changing grip on wheel.<br>
Rotary knobs mostly useful e.g. during pit stops.
&nbsp Clutch paddles are desirable.<br>
I find wheels less than 300mm diameter or over $600 uncomfortable.
&nbsp  Here are candidate rims:

<h3><a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJO2MOqqe74>Conspit 300 GT - Dan Suzuki review</a></h3>
<pre>
Buttons not feeling too too clicky, too binary.
So much clever stuff going on in this wheel to me it's absolutely mind-blowing.
All the encoders are nice and and easy to turn.
Rear buttons are in perfect reach super useful.
The ergonomics are for my hands close to perfect,
definitely in the top five of the most ergonomic wheels that I have ever used.
The display is a nice gimmick;  I don't find it terribly useful,
but it also doesn't hurt to have there it is nice for these things like
without a display it would be way less useful so for that alone
the display is really really nice but for the rest I think it's very small,
it's not super easy to spot things while you're racing.

Overall build quality absolutely excellent;  it's a super light wheel
without being too light and having that plastic feel.
It still feels very solid;  you have super responsive force feedback, every detail.
Encoder remap functionality is a super nice thing.
Shifters very quiet by the way, still feel very tactile and nice to use.
I've tested wheels that are like more than twice the price
which are definitely not as good as this Conspit 300 GT.

Cons:
- The aluminum back and carbon front do not perfectly match across the whole thing
  so there's a potential for slight light bleed here in this corner.
- The display is not (yet) SimHub compatible.
- Dashboards that come with it are a little bit limited
- it also does not come with a QR
- thumbwheel detents could be stronger (and can be changed)

This wheel absolutely packs basically all the pro features that you find on high-end wheels
and puts it in a very affordable package and we'll see where the dashboard will go.
I expect a very nice dash coming due to the cooperation with lovely dashboard
so we'll see how that goes but for now it's still like it's an easy recommendation.
Honestly I don't even understand how they sell it at this price point.
I don't understand how they make a profit on this wheel.  I work in the business;
I have no idea, so yeah as you can probably tell I am very impressed with this wheel
and can pretty much recommend it to anyone that looks for a wheel
even if you look for a more expensive wheel like it does not really get much better than this
if you like these features if you like the form factor.

<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gf0qxHGP-U>random callsign considers the clutches <i>meh</i></a>,
<br>and Conspit software for game telemetry display is wanting,
<br>but <a href=https://store.lsr.gg/blogs/news/conspit-lovely-sim-racing-extend-partnership>Lovely</a> software is promised.
<p><a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo9FPAm_3wg>@chepilevski</a> considers it by far the best value on the market.</p>

<h3>blekenbleu rant</h3>
<table><tr><td>
<b>Mostly decent, but IMO doomed hardware</b>
<dl><dt><i>Vulnerable proprietary USB</i>
<dd>Inserting keyed connector is practically impossible with rim attached to base.
<br> &emsp; e.g. SimXperience violent calibration cycle should run <b>before</b> cable connection
<br> &emsp; - attach GT 300 to base <i>without cable</i>
<br> &emsp; - power up wheel base, wait for calibration thrash completion
<br> &emsp; - detach GT 300
<br> &emsp; - attach USB
<br> &emsp; - reattach GT 300 to base
<dd>USB connector sticks straight down, will inevitably get wiped out during wheel rotation.
<br>- is their business plan to profit from replacement cables?
<br>- in use, cable will wrap around the quick release;
<br>- instead of radially, connector should point tangentially,
<br>&emsp; relieving stress on the cable and reducing connector liability to tangential leverage.
<dt><br><i>Simultaneous back button and clutch paddle access is problematic</i>
<dt><i>As with other funky switches, rotation randomly actuates lateral button events.</i>
<dt><br>BS aside, GT 300 has 40 buttons (26 useful) and 2 clutch axes
<dd>Conspit is evidently delusional about their crap CONSPIT LINK
<dt><br><b>Software from hell</b>
<dt><i>YouTube influencers love products with miserably documented software</i>
<dd>- gives them pretexts for lame brosplain videos
<dt><i>starts badly, then goes downhill</i>
<dd>- each ConspitLink launch provokes User Account Control

<dt><br><b>clicking <b>PW1</b> in "Tutorial List" hangs ConspitLink</b>

<dd><br>- despite only one available product, requires user selection before proceeding
<dd>- wacky, but pointless overlay:<br><img src=image/pointless.jpg>
<dd>- "Lights & Buttons" is seemingly really only about lights <i>on</i> buttons..?
<br> &emsp; - rotary encoders have "Lighting Mode" 1 or 2, unexplained...
<br> &emsp; - "Flashing" option doesn't
<dd>- "help" windows populated with random buzzwords, e.g.:<br><img width=740 src=image/BuzzwordSalad.jpg>

<dt><br><i>"Manual" clutch mode seemingly reports most depressed position of either</i>, wtf

<dt><br><b>By default, 3 rotary encoders do nothing</b>
<dt><i>With LINK running, rotary encoder knobs can map to SimHub buttons 30-35</i>
<dd>- only 31, 32 (SimHub 30, 31) sensed by Game Controllers control panel
<dd>- I am <b>extremely</b> reluctant to attempt "Save to Flash"
