<h3>2023 installation: Sim Commander, Assetto Corsa, Content Manager</h3>
Things have changed, <i>not to be confused with improved</i>.<ol>
<li>Install <a href=#AC>Assetto Corsa</a> first
<li>Install SimXperience AccuForce, then <a href=#SX>Sim Commander</a>
<li>Install pedals, shifters, wheels, other controllers
<li>Install <a href=#CM>Content Manager</a> (and Custom Shader)
</ol>

<a name=AC><h3>Assetto Corsa</h3></a>
Keep in mind that, despite sim pretensions, AC is at heart <i>a game</i>.
<li>Computer games are largely about making usage unnecessarily hard.
<li>Sim programmers use that excuse for undocumented miserable user interfaces.
<li><b>Do the bare minimum to install;&nbsp <i>do not attempt to run before controller installations</i></b>

<a name=SX><h3>SimXperience</h3></a><ul>
<li>Sim Commander will search for games (<a href=#AC>Assetto Corsa</a>) and AccuForce;&nbsp install this <i>after them</i>.
<li>Unlike Assetto Corsa, SimXperience has some documentation,<br>
 but it is so disorganized and incorrect that users may arguably be better off <i>without</i> it.<br>
For example, <a href="https://www.simxperience.com/slides/sim-commander-software-documentation-6"><b>Sim Commander Software Documentation</b></a>
 yammers on about licensing,<br>
 while this <a href="https://www.simxperience.com/sim-commander-4-5-licensing-changes"><b>Sim Commander 4.5</b></a>,
which is <i>NOT</i> in that documentation,<br>
notes that licensing is now accomplished by providing email address and password.<br>
Sim Commander 4.5 does NOT clarify that login is essential for licensing,<br>
 nor does it warn to install games and SimXperience hardware before proceeding.</ul>

<a name=CM><h3>Content Manager (and Custom Shader)</h3></a><ul>
<li>immediately:&nbsp <code>SETTINGS -> CUSTOM SHADERS PATCH</code><br>
without it, some mods cannot install (e.g. <a href="https://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/sebring-1966.53663/">Sebring 1966</a>)
<li><code>ABOUT</code> has recommendations about settings
</ul>
