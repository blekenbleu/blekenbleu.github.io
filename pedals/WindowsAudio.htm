<a name=intro>
<h4>Introduction</h4></a>
<p>It is useful to keep in mind that Windows became successful by:<ul compact>
<li>moving fast
<li>trying to maintain backward compatibility.
</ul>
There are many controls on many panels that interact in many unobvious ways to affect<br>
the many unobvious ways that sound works (or doesn't).</p>
<a name=listen>
<h4>microphone</h4></a>
Windows has a "listening" concept, which is related, but not essential, to microphone usage.<br>
To disable listening by <code>Host Process for Windows Services</code>:<ol compact>
<li>Right-click volume icon.
<li>Select "Open Sound settings"<br>
This [code]Sound[/code] settings panel is also available from the main [Settings] panel under [System]
<li>Select "Sound Control Panel" in <code>Settings | Sound </code> right sidebar under <b>Related Settings</b>
<li>Select "Recording" tab in the newly opened <code>Sound</code> window
<li>Select, in turn, each device
<li>Select "Properties" button in bottom right corner
<li>Select "Listen" tab in the newly opened <code>Properties</code> window
<li>Un-check the box next to "Listen to this device"
<li>Select "OK" to exit that <code>Properties</code> window
<li>Return to 5. for each subsequent device.
<li>Select "OK" again to exit <code>Sound</code> window
</ol>
<a name="channels">
<h4>Stereeo vs Quadraphonic vs 5.1 Surround vs 7.1 Surround</h4></a>
Windows supports 4 channel configurations for non-Digital <code>Playback</code> devices<br>
in the <code>Sound</code> window of step 4., above.<br>
<code>Quadraphonic</code> seemingly is of no use for haptics.<br>
To verify and/or configure correct output channel settings,<ol compact>
<li>Select the <code>Playback</code> tab
<li>Select, in turn, each non-digital playback device
<li>Select the lower left "Configure" button
<li>Select the number of outputs actually available;<br>
no need to test in this window; press "Next"
<li>enable all possible "speakers";<br>
test any currently connected and powered, then press "Next"
<li>select all speakers as full range;<br>
otherwise low frequencies will be rerouted, then press "Next", then "Finish".
</ol>
<a name=levels>
<h4>Output channel Levels and Enabling</h4>
Just because channels are correctly configured does not necessarily mean<br>
that audio signals will find their way out.<br>
In the <a href=#channels>above</a> step 3.,<ol compact>
<li>instead of  "Configure", press "Properties"
<li>Select the "Levels" tab<br>
<code>100</code> will generally be the wanted value
<li>Select the "Advanced" tab<br>
<code>24 bit, 48000Hz</code> will generally be a good setting,<br>
but <img align=center src="Test.gif"> if possible
<li>Select the "Spatial sound" tab, then <code>Off</code>
<li>back in step 2 of <a href=#listen>microphone</a>,<br>
Select "Manage sound devices" instead of "Sound Control Panel"
<li>Select, in turn, each item in <code>Output devices</code> under "Disabled"
<li>Enable as appropriate
<li>Enabled devices can also be tested here.<br>
You may notice that some devices are nonsensical.<br>
For example, Windows 10 separately lists Sound Blaster X-Fi <code>Speaker</code> and <code>SPDIF-Out</code><br>
but testing either generates audio from both.&nbsp Blame Microsoft or Creative... I blame both.
</ol>
<a name=control>
<h4>Control Panel</h4>
Note that while Sound control panels are accesible from Settings menus,<br>
game controllers (other than X-Box) are NOT; they are accessed from the separate<br>
<code>Control Panel</code> applet, under "Hardware and Sound" > "Devices and Printers".<br>
On my system, at least, Thrustmaster's TH8 shifter is under "Multimedia Devices",<br>
while SideWinder joystick is under "Devices", along with sound cards, routers, mice, VR Headset...<br>
Right-clicking either SideWinder or TH8 offers <code>Game Controller Settings</code>, so it could be worse...<br>
