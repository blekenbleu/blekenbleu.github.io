When I ordered the AccuForce DIY wheelbase,<br>
Ascher Racing listed a $27 steering wheel adapter<br>
for the non-standard 14mm AccuForce shaft.<br>
When it became clear that AccuForce was overwhelming<br>
<a href="index.htm#OG14">my 14mm flange</a>,  Ascher's adapter was no longer listed.<br>
FWIW, Ascher currently has no products available...<br>
14mm turns out to be a non-standard motor shaft diameter,<br>
and other motor shafts use keyways instead of set screws.<br>
Neither SimXperience nor Ricmotech sell their hub separately.<br><br>
The AccuForce motor has about 2.2 inches of exposed shaft,<br>
leaving about an inch after mounting thru a 5/4 deck plank.<br>
An eBay seller offered 1x2.5-inch aluminum by the inch,<br>
so I ordered 2 inches.<br>
The steering wheel adapter recess inside diameter is 2.45";<br>
2.5" hole saws on hand can cut a 1x2x2.5 inch block to fit,<br>
but aluminum cutting oil is wanted to avoid overheating, etc.<br>
</td></tr></table>
Ordered cutting oil and a 14mm drill bit, 3 mounting holes and a set screw hole must be drilled and tapped;<br>
A slot wants cutting so that this collar can be clamped tightly to the shaft, taking stress off the set screw<br>
but also requiring another hole drilled and tapped for a clamp bolt.<br>
<img src=image/clampdwgs.jpg><br clear=all>
Orientation of the 3 hub adapter mounting screw threaded holes was a consideration;<br>
the right-hand option was selected because it moved the clamp bolt location away from the center bore,<br>
so applying more clamping leverage.<br>
The collar is so stiff that tightening that clamp bolt does not visibly close the slot.

1/8" holes were drilled at center punch locations for<br>
14mm bore, clamp bolt and 2 of 3 hub adapter holes.<br>
A third adapter hole gets drilled <i>after</i> clamping.<br>
The cutting fluid is messy to apply;<br>
it wicks along the dispensing nozzle and dissolves print.<br><br>
Drill the future 14mm bore to 1/4" for the hole saw pilot.

Hole saw flings chips and cutting fluid;<br>
wear an expendible shirt.<br>
Heat is the enemy of cutting edges;<br>
bring the saw only briefly in contact with aluminum<br>
to generate a few chips, then back off.&nbsp While tedious,<br>
saw teeth nominally intended for wood were still fairly sharp<br>
at the end.&nbsp The aluminum gets hot and expands enough<br>
to seize the saw blade if not allowed to cool.<br>
Cutting was done in 4 sessions and from both sides.

Because sawn from both sides<br>
with less than ideal equipment and technique,<br>
cuts in some places mismatched by 1/8" or so.<br><br>
That was addressed somewhat using a belt sander.<br><br>
Clamp bolt pilot hole is at the edge of the flat;<br>
it should have been bored out to threading diameter<br>
before hole sawing.<br><br>
Note wood block beneath aluminum block to more or less<br>
locate it squarely above vise > 1/2"<br>
 to avoid hole saw collision with jaws.

The two hub adapter pilot holes align nicely;<br>
2-1/2" hole saw cut aluminum about 4mm too small<br>
for a tight fit in hub adapter recess.

Found a socket head 1/4-20 bolt suitable for clamping;<br>
drilled 1/8" pilot hole out to 13/64",<br>

even with generous cutting oil application.<br>
1/4" is also a good set screw size;
ordered with a tap... &nbsp &nbsp <br>

That quick release design depends on small elastomer buttons to take up slack,<br>
but those eventually compress, resulting in bayonet clamp ring going from too tight to too loose.<br><br>
