<h4>Introduction</h4></a>
Bass Shaker effects are output as audio signals, instead of to rumble motors.<br>
As of 18 Sep 2019, my SimHub lists 28 profiles for Any Game, 1 for RaceRoom and 1 for Assetto Corsa.<br>
This does not mean that 28 profiles work well with any game;<br>
merely that 1 depends on a property unique to RR and another uses an AC-unique property.<br>
<dl>
<dt>Default profile
<dd>17 effects as initially received; only RPM was IMO useful as provided
<dt>AC1
<dd>2 effects; my first prune to provided Default for only WHEELS SLIPS and RPMS
<dt>RPM-modulated up/downshifts
<dd>by request
<dt>speed shifts
<dd>Tactile effect for shifts should IMO reflect shift smoothness,<br>
which presumably corresponds in speed changes during those shifts.<br>
This effect currently explores three formulae, each gated by gear changes:<ul compact>
<li>high-pass filtering of changes in speed
<li>surge acceleration
<li>surge acceleration and high-pass filtering of same (jerk)</ul>

<i>Front left = Gear; Front right = surge acceleration; Rear left = high pass filter of speed changes;
Rear right = surge acceleration + high pass filter of acceleration changes</i><br></font><br>
Since <i>Rear left</i> is arguably a recalculation of <i>Front right</i>, results differ surprisingly..<br>
