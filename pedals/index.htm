<h3>Samsung Odyssey+ HMD for WMR</h3>
<a href="https://www.assettocorsa.net/forum/index.php#assetto-corsa-support-forum-pc-version.12">Assetto Corsa</a>
is a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/244210/Assetto_Corsa/">Steam</a> "game",
which when launched for Odyssey+ ends up also running SteamVR and WMR portal.<br>
The game runs fine with TH8A shift and G29 wheel and pedals, when displaying on a monitor.<br>
When Options->Video->Rendering Mode set from Single Screen to OpenVr,<br>
then starting Drive launchs WMR portal and SteamVR, but loses TH8A and G29 controls.<br>
Within Drive, the pit menu usually appears, but disappears once driving, and Esc does not work,<br>
so unable to e.g. gracefully exit or return to pit.<br>
This is probably SteamVR expecting inputs from a game controller..<br>
<br>
Sim driving by VR means not seeing controls,
unless video capture of controls is reinserted in 3D sim view,
without which controls on steering wheel are useless,
but that simplifies direct drive options.<br>
<a href="">AccuForce</a> has a good reputation, but non-standard 14mm shaft
(shared with Lenze MCS09)
limits available adapters for 70mm steering wheels to
<a href="https://www.ascher-racing.com/shop/clamping-set/">Ascher Racing</a><br>
Installation is described in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk_NCV-8R5w">this video</a>.<br>
Given that AccuForce DIY motor attachment is also non-standard,
spending another $100 for <a href="https://simxperience.com/Products/Accessories/AccuForceSteering/AccuForceSteeringSystem/tabid/868/ProductID/2267/language/en-US/recordid/4167110/Default.aspx">"Your Way"</a> instead of DIY seems cost-effective..<br>
<br>
Ricmotech sells a <a href="https://www.ricmotech.com/Ricmotech_Mini_Mite_Direct_Drive_Steering_System_p/rmt-mm-base.htm">Mini-mite</a> that is <a href="https://www.racedepartment.com/threads/accuforce-mounting-help.171738/post-3021710">reportedly an AccuForce clone</a>.<br>
They also sell a <a href="https://www.ricmotech.com/Mounting_Bracket_for_SimLab_Heusinkveld_Chassis_p/rmt-ddaf-slabadpt.htm">mounting
adapter</a> for $28.50 that converts it to Bodnar / Kollmorgen front mounting.
The <a href="https://simxperience.com/Portals/0/Files/AccuForce/Controller_Plug_Descriptions_Dimensions.jpg">AccuForce Controller</a>

<h3>SimLab TR1 Chassis</h3>
I like the overall design of <a href="https://sim-lab.eu/product/teamredline-tr1-chassis/">this cockpit</a>:
<img src="https://sim-lab.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/TR105-e1533415335250-100x100.jpg"><br clear=all>
<img src="https://sim-lab.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/TR109-100x100.jpg"><br clear=all>
except for being black, back-ordered and 412 Euros + shipping.
<br>
The 350 Euro <a href="https://simetik.com/web/product/k2-cockpit/">Simetek K2-R</a> seems similar, except not (much) 80/20<br>
Adding their proprietary and optional shifter mount, etc, quickly increases the price.<br>
