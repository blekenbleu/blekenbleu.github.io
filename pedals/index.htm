<b><b>background</b></b><br>
Some drivers quickly turn competitive times in cars and on circuits new to them.<br>
Even less like me, some folks seemingly launch new apps<br>
and comfortably master controls with minimal instruction and tweaking.<br>
The following is <i><b>not</b></i> tailored for you but more for tweakers and incrementalists..<br><br>

<details><summary><i>your mileage may vary</i> <code>[click for details]</code></summary>
Niels Heusinkveld, owner of the <a href="https://heusinkveld.com/">sim pedal company</a>,
described his first <i>real</i> track experience:<br>
<iframe align=center width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ExJEGp9itHE"></iframe><br>
I was struck by his lack of appreciation for inertial forces,<br>
although he certainly noted tail-wagging from too much throttle out of wet corners.<br>
As a 20-year sim racer, Niels learned to mostly depending on visual cues,<br>
not to mention (although he did) less precision in real pedals than his sim pedal products<br>
and lack of weight and feedback from real power steering.<br>
He reported a somewhat sore neck from roughly 1-G lateral acceleration,<br>
while depending mostly on visual cues and control feedback, rather than G-forces.<br>
He was surprised about understeer with relatively small slip and steering angles.<br>
He was unaware where he looked on track, contrasted to awareness of bezels with triple screens.<br>
While he was aware of e.g. the rear stepping out, that seemed mostly from change of view.<br>
Compared to sim, "real life was wrong".<ul>
<li>Tired synchros made real shifts notably slower
<li>Feeling buttock G forces was not a revelation
<li>seat feel did not add a dimension
<li>slides were mostly noted visually
<li>Sounds and smells were annoying and distracting
<li>Sense of speed was similar
<li>The bug did not bite; sim comfort and convenience are preferred</ul>

By comparison, I am relatively unused to depending on feedback from controls<br>
and probably more than most "real" drivers depended on G forces<br>
and relatively less on vision, presumably because lacking confidence in depth perception,<br>
since my vision did not fuse until I was in my mid-40s. &nbsp Consequently,<br>
I need <i>more practice</i> to learn feedback from controls and ShakeSeat.<br>
<a name=fresnel>
Odyssey+ image sharpness is probably not enough to instill real confidence</a>,<br>
particularly since VR resolution with Fresnel lenses is best in the center,<br>
 but wants far focus which my trifocal eyeglasses cannot provide.<br>
<br>
This video by another sim driver with previous track experience and consequential<br>
G-force unlearning / relearning issues: 4:15/15:48 &nbsp
<iframe align=center width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XjcW3qzWTyE"></iframe><br>
<br>
FWIW, professional and better amateur drivers probably adapt more quickly between sim and real racing,<br>
since G-forces differ so much between street and many race cars.<br>
<br>
What follows is biased towards streetable BMWs with power steering and brakes,<br>
minimal aero and enough mods to be pleasant on track, but far from real racing cars.<br>
For example, neither brutally stiff brake pedals nor massive steering effort are wanted.

<br>
<pre>
15 Apr 2018 - bought Assetto Corsa from Steam;
had to reboot to resolve error after installation.
After splash screens, no idea what to do;
there had been some brief message about keys to press,
but I missed whatever it said.

Assetto Corsa packages (base $20)
Ultimate bundle $40 (but wait for a sale)
Dream pack 1 $7 - Alfa GTA, Nurburgring-Nordschleife
others seem less interesting to me...

Assetto Corsa content takes a lot of space;
mods cannot be added to ~\Documents\Assetto Corsa\
https://steamcommunity.com/app/244210/discussions/0/619568793783231679/

Moved that folder from SSD && created a <JUNCTION>:
mklink /J "C:\Users\bleke\Documents\Assetto Corsa" "G:\Gateway\my\Assetto Corsa"

Used Steam to change default content directory to G:\Gateway\my\Steam\
... and also created Assetto Corsa backup there.

Steam folder in Program Files is 867MB without Assetto Corsa
Assetto Corsa folder is 24.4GB

In Steam app, under LIBRARY dropdown, select GAMES, right-click
Assetto Corsa > Properties > LOCAL FILES dropdown >MOVE INSTALL FOLDER..

<ul>
<li> Single screen sucks, can neither estimate car width<br>
&nbsp nor see right turn apexes.&nbsp vFOV - approx 33,<br>
per 15:44/17:37 in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpnlSnqWy6g
<li> adding 2 carpet spikes (hacked from M6x35 screws) to front holes<br>
adequately anchored the pedals.
<li> Remaining two M6x35 screws (from TV VESA mount kit) replaced TH9A clamp.
<li> After many laps in the NA Miata, the E30 M3 feels like an overpowered boat.<br>
The Toyota 86 is easier for me to drive quickly..

Once parts are sorted, learning to use them generally works better taken incrementally.<br>
Learning a new track in a car with unknown behaviors using controls that respond unexpectedly<br>
can be frustrating, off-putting and inefficient.<br>
To mitigate information overload, seriously consider first driving a <a href="https://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/skidpad.5554/">skid pad</a>,
 then a <a href="https://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/clarksville-indiana_sportsdome-speedway_figure-8-oval.28318/">figure 8</a>.<br>
Assetto Corsa included <i>neither</i> in its offering; they are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMGMgIjZCmw">available as mods</a>.<br>
<a href="https://www.assettocorsa.net/forum/index.php#assetto-corsa-support-forum-pc-version.12">Assetto Corsa</a>
is a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/244210/Assetto_Corsa/">Steam</a> "game",
which when launched for WMR HMD also runs SteamVR and WMR portal.<br>
<a name=USB>
The game ran fine</a> with TH8A shifter and G29 wheel and pedals, when displaying on a monitor.<br>
When Options->Video->Rendering Mode set from Single Screen to OpenVR,<br>
then starting Drive launched WMR portal and SteamVR, but lost TH8A and G29 controls.<br></a>
Within Drive, the pit menu appears, but disappears once driving.<br>
Esc does not work while pit menu is active, so unable to e.g. gracefully exit.<br>
<br>
Instead, what works: Install <a href="#contentmgr">Content Manager</a> in Steam and launch from <a href="steam://open/console">there</a>.<br>
<a name=VRC>Customize mouse Forward and Back buttons to [Ctrl + space bar] and [Esc] keystrokes, respectively, for SteamVR<br></a>

"Some Alternate launchers such as Content Manager, run AC as administrator,<br>

Content manager is only supported by SimHub when using "Official" or "AppId" start modes,<br>

Content Manager may have already modified the games files<br>

<a name=pedals>
<h4> Problems</h4></a>
Lacking inertial cues from braking velocity changes, sim racing seems harder (IMO) than real.<br>
Although Logitech improved pedal <i>feel</i> with their G29, braking control remains problematic:,<ul>
<li> signal to sim software is based on pedal movement distance, not pressure.<br>
This can be largely corrected by controls within Assetto Corssa.
<li> feedback, if any, for tires losing grip during braking comes thru the steering wheel,
instead of the brake pedal.<br>
Better feedback wants direct drive steering, load cell brake pedal and <a href="#SimHarness">active harness tensioning</a>.
</ul>

<h4>Project</h4>
Brake simulation shortcomings can be mitigated by:<ul>
<li> replacing brake potentiometer with a <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/gOjAf">load cell</a><ul>
<li>That mod uses analog op amp, problematic with Logitech's brake curve, but fine with <a href="#analog">AccuForce</a>
<li>instead of custom circuit board, use a cheap <b>INA333</b> (or AD623) low power rail-to-rail instrumentation amplifier module:<br>
<img src=image/INA333front.jpg><img src=image/INA333rear.jpg><br clear=all>
<b>Instructions</b> &nbsp The on-board 3.3V low-dropout LDO regulator chip directly supplies power to the INA333 amplifier.<br>
The amplifier uses a 3.3V single-ended power supply mode, with V- connected to GND,<br>
and V+ connected to the 3.3V output of the LDO.<br>
VIN+ non-inverting input, VIN inverting input. R3 on the board is not soldered.<br>
VCC regulator LDO input 5V.<br>

G29 brake pedal rumble motor was uncompelling:&nbsp <img align=top src="image/rumblepedal.jpg"><br>
Finally received Dayton Thruster for brake pedal shake:<br>
<img src="image/Dayton.jpg"><br clear=all>
Piezo contact mic sensor temporarily hot-glued for <a href="haptic.htm">haptic measurement exercises</a>.<br>
<br>
Thruster attaches by pressure-sensitive adhesive, best used only once. &nbsp <img src="image/3M.jpg"><br>
The center brake pad screw hole was usurped to mount the Thruster:&nbsp <img src="image/ThrusterScrew.jpg"><br>
A longer screw matching the G29 pedal mount threads was located and screwed just far enough to barely protrude: &nbsp <img src="image/screw.jpg"><br>
Thrusters ideally want rigid, non-resonant but fairly light mounts; a scrap of polymer-coated 10mm MDF was sourced.<br>
Thruster mount scratched by mounting screw:&nbsp <img src="image/scratch.jpg"><br>
Brake pedal pad reinstalled offset right, facilitating heel/toe:&nbsp <img src="image/offsetBrake.jpg"><br>
For Thruster clearance, mount must be off-center.<br>
 Screw hole was counter-bored,<br>
 large enough for socket so that nut could be recessed. &nbsp <img src="image/recessed.jpg"><br>
Mount will be cleaned with Windex and wiped dry to promote bonding to Thruster's 3M adhesive. &nbsp <img src="image/offset.jpg"<br clear=all>
<br>
Properly applied, hot glue bonds well enough to peel piezo off their metal discs; ask how I know. &nbsp <img src="image/piezo_damage.jpg"><br clear=all>
Obtaining that bond consistently is difficult, and hot glue's resilience is not ideal for capturing vibration energy,<br>
Consequently, two-part epoxy is a better choice for bonding piezo pairs and mass-loading.</details>

<li><b>isolation:</b><br>
 &nbsp; When tactile transducers are NOT directly stimulating a sim racer,<br>
 &nbsp; then energy is unavoidably wasted on whatever that transducer is attached.<br>
 &nbsp; So much as possible, such mass should be minimized.<br>
 &nbsp; That typically involves isolating shaken masses from others,<br>
 &nbsp; ideally using underdamped springs, which may be simple elastomer bushings<br>
 &nbsp; or more elaborate spring and damper assemblies, e.g.:<br>
 &nbsp; <a href="https://simtag.shop/gb/accueil/482-racebass-isolators.html"><img src="image/racebass-isolators.jpg"></a><br clear=all>
 &nbsp; ... but in instances where isolated mass (e.g. seat) must also resist forces in some direction,<br>
 &nbsp; then e.g. suspension arms are wanted to resist those forces while isolating tactile energy in other directions.

for ShakeSeat:&nbsp <details><summary><b>G-force modulated 4 corner tire slip</b></summary>
<a name="Simshakeseat"><i>Background and disclaimers</i></a><br>
My sim driving experience is with an office chair, wheel stand and mostly Assetto Corsa.<br>
I have no experience with the
<a href="https://www.simracingstudio.com/product-page/srs-shakekit-shakeseat-integrated-with-shakebox-lite">full SRS ShakeKit</a>,
which may offer a superior experience.<br>
Without a harness to keep one's back contacting them,<br>
back transducers in <a href="https://www.simracingstudio.com/product-page/srs-shakekit-plus-includes-srs-license-for-bass-shaker">ShakeKit Plus</a>
seem of debatable benefit.<br>
<br>
Already using SimHub with available motherboard 7.1 sound<br>
and obsolete Denon surround receiver,<br>
 a ShakeSeat pad was ordered because:<br>
* <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlJfIFhdk1c&t=306s">Sim Racing Garage review</a><br>
* Dayton TT25-16 pucks were, at the time, in short supply elsewhere<br>
An equivalent <a href="#pad">can be made</a> using Dayton pucks with e.g.<br>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GZFJ1CN">40cm square zippered cushion covers</a>
and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B012TWTUMU">EVA foam floor tiles</a><br>

Standard SimHub ShakeIt tire slip does not consider tire loading.<br>
For example, an inside tire may be fully unloaded during cornering,<br>
so very high slippage, but no perceived sensation in actual driving.<br>
<br>
This attempts to approximate track sensations from street tires,<br>
when securely harnessed in a fitted racing seat.<br>
Usefulness of such haptic feedback may vary widely among users<br>
* e.g.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExJEGp9itHE&t=3550s">Niels Heusinkveld indicated that seat feel is overrated</a><br>
&nbsp .. and he cued more visually off horizon movement.<br>
IMO, this feedback is less compelling than that from
<a href="https://www.racedepartment.com/threads/2dof-harness-tensionner-with-fly-ptmover.194331/">2DOF harness tensioners</a>,<br>
but reduces a sense of "something missing".<br>
<br>
Unambiguously directional haptic cues seemingly involve substantially direct stimulation of<br>
body parts, e.g. left and right thighs, lumbars and/or sit bones.<br>
<img src="image/SRS_EVA.jpg"><br clear=all>
Sensations to be simulated here:<br>
squeal for small slippage, transitioning to moaning with more slippage,<br>
then shuddering near breakaway,<br>
with much less feeling from lightly loaded tires
(rear when braking, inside when cornering).<br>
<br>
Implementation embellishes SimHub Wheels slip effect using Custom Effects<br>
1. latitudinal and longitudinal acceleration properties<br>
2. loaded tire slips, products of tire slip properties times accelerations<br>
<br>
Recent SimHub versions provide <a name=accel>Acceleration</a> properties<br>
that had been estimated from changes in speed and yaw samples to proxy G force.<br>
Earlier SimHub versions sampled speed and yaw slower than Assetto Corsa sample updates,<br>
resulting in some changes 2x others, which code here detects and mitigates.<br>
<br>
Left channel <b>Lateral G-force proxy</b>:<pre><code>// lateral acceleration proxy
var y = $prop('OrientationYaw');
const tc = 3;  // IIR smoothing factor
const noise = 0.01 // non-linear filter threshold

// initialize IIR filter history
if(null==root["yaw"]) {
   root["yaw"] = $prop('OrientationYaw');
   root["delta_y"] = 0.2;
}
if (null==root["Gyb4"])
  root["Gyb4"] = 0.5;

var dy = y - root["yaw"];       // change between sample intervals

// yaw flips at +/- 180
if (Math.abs(dy) > 180) {  // yaw went +/- 180
  if (Math.abs(root["yaw"]) > 150)
    dy = -(y + root["yaw"]);
}

root["yaw"] = y;
y = root["delta_y"];    // previous sample change

// mitigate delta spikes from missed samples
var my = 1;     // sample interval
if ((Math.abs(dy * y) > noise)  // missed sample?
 && (Math.abs(dy) > Math.abs(1.8 * y)))
  dy /= (my = 2);

root["delta_y"] = dy;

// IIR low-pass filter
var Gyb4 = root["Gyb4"];        // IIR output
Gyb4 += my * (dy - Gyb4) / tc;  // low-pass IIR
root["Gyb4"] = Gyb4;
return 50 + (50 * Gyb4);  // range 0-100
// 50 corresponds to no G force</code></pre>
<b>Longitudinal acceleration</b> (right channel) is similar, substituting speed for yaw<br>
<br>
<b>Loaded tire slip corner effects</b> use products of tire slips and G force proxies:
<pre><code>return .01*$prop('GameRawData.Physics.WheelSlip01')
    *($prop('ShakeITBSV3Plugin.Export.proxy_G.Left'))*(90-$prop('ShakeITBSV3Plugin.Export.proxy_G.Right'))
// since this multiplies two properties with 0-100 ranges,
// results must be reduced by 100 to return the same range
// left vs right G-force distributions are applied to wheel slips
//  by (proxy_G.Left) and (100-proxy_G.Left),
// while front-to-rear G-force distributions are by
//  ( proxy_G.Right-10) vs (90- proxy_G.Right)
// to reflect that, while inner wheels may become fully unloaded in corners,
// track cars are expected to fully unload neither nor rear wheels
</code></pre>
These two CUSTOM EFFECTS could be combined,<br>
except that G-force proxy properties are also used by<br>
a Custom serial device for <a href="#SimHarness">2DOF harness tensioning</a>.<br>

A pioneer in converting sim telemetry to bass shaker audio,<br>
that is now also available from (free) <a href=#ShakeIt>SimHub</a> as well as SRS' ShakeKit.<br>
SimXperience has since integrated SimVibe with
<a href="https://www.simxperience.com/en-us/products/software/simcommander4.aspx">Sim Commander 4</a>,<br>
which also drives their <a href="#DD">AccuForce direct drive steering wheel</a> (<i>acquired</i>).<br>
<br>
SimXperience warns that multiple identical sound adapters can be problematic.<br>
Both Aurora motherboard and Samsung Odyssey+ sound identify as Realtek:<br>
Intel and NVIDIA audio are presumably about HDMI. &nbsp Despite nomenclature,<br>
Windows 10 Sound Blaster X-Fi support appears to be only stereo.<br>
Realtek motherboard audio is enabled only after plugging into 1/8 phone jacks.<br>
Realtek USB2.0 device disappears when Odyssey+ HMD sleeps,<br>
reportedly confusing SimVibe/Sim Commander 4 (SC4),<br>
which evidently keys off sequence in list of available devices.<br>
Since Assetto Corsa already loses access to G29 and TH8A<br>
unless launched <b>after</b> Steam and Content Manager,<br>
inserting SC4 launch may also be problematic.<br>
<img src="image/AudioDevices.png"><br clear=all>
<br>
"You have to select the audio-source in SC4 while the Odyssey is running."<br>
Then launch SC4 after SteamVR and activate the profile last, so don't launch games with SC4.<br>
I would prefer a fix, but once you got used to it, it's not a game-breaker,<br>
because in window-mode you can launch SC4 while the game is loading.<br>
If the headset falls to sleep mode, the output in SC4 is dead and
<a href="https://simxperience.com/Default.aspx?tabid=742&g=posts&m=24721#post24721">
you need to re-launch it the next time</a>.<br>
<br>
The first bullet for Sim Commander 4: "Simple To Use"<br>
https://simxperience.com/en-us/products/software/simcommander4.aspx<br>
* if true, users would notice without it being pointed out.<br>
* as is nearly always the case, emphatically untrue,<br>
if "use" means anything other than launching a default<br>
or something useful [but painfully] configured and debugged..<br>
* Consider it a fair warning that, on the same page, Tutorials require Flash.<br>
- first (for installation) should be skipped - applied to SC3 and is flat misleading<br>
- second may be still somewhat relevant, but requires much homework to correctly fill blanks<br>
- last SimVibe could be valuable, if still accurate<br>
<br>
At least on my Windows 10 64-bit Home PC,<br>
pop-up windows essential to Sim Commander 4 installation were hidden beneath<br>
the main setup window, resulting in no progress until raised from the taskbar.<br>
<br>
Sim Commander license code displayed online was truncated;<br>
fortunately, gif was fully visible after download (to USB1TB/Sim).<br>
After initial setup, Sim Commander splash window plays obnoxious drum solo,<br>
which can be stifled by clearing Background Music in Control Center.<br>
<br>
Rerunning Auto Search found Assetto Corsa, but not games in <code>E:\my\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common</code><br>
.. which were added manually, but still do not show up on SC4 splash screen.<br>
REALLY need to find getting started documentation!!<br>
<br>
Configuring SC2 launch by Content Manager was doomed;<br>
no Output Mixer and seemingly no ShakeSeat output.<br>
<br>
This was cured by adding a fresh Sim Commander profile<br>
(using big + at bottom of main screen) and selecting Assetto Corsa,<br>
then duplicating and changing game to Content Manager.<br>
After that, even the original Content Manager profile has an Output Mixer...<br>
<br>
SimVibe Tuning guide https://simxperience.com/Portals/0/Files/SimVibe/SimVibe%20Tuning%20Guide.pdf<br>
<br>
SimVibe chassis appears to support neither traction loss nor ABS,<br>
but has estimated wheel lockup (mono), oversteer and "custom simvibe effect"<br>
<br>
Good news: switching from single screen to openvr in Content Manager<br>
launched from SC4 did not lose SimVib, but did lose remapped mouse buttons<br>
until logging out and back in, then launching CM from steam,<br>
THEN launching (really, just attaching) CM/AC from SC4,<br>
at which point SimVib and mouse buttons both worked.<br>
<br>
Somehow overnight, SC4 loses all profilesexcept Forza 7 and AC from scratch..?<br>
<br>
SC4 still launches a useless black abomination that is presumably its so-called Dashboard<br>
<br>
After fiddling with Sim Commander 4 SimVibe
<li> it is more about simulating road feel than haptics feedback to help drive
<li> documentation sucks and effect names are unhelpful

Two G29 wheel issues:<br>
1) small diameter<br>

&nbsp goes 'molasses' and unresponsive when cornering limits exceeded.</details>
