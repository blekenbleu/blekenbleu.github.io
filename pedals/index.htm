<h3>Samsung Odyssey+ HMD for WMR</h3>
<a href="https://www.assettocorsa.net/forum/index.php#assetto-corsa-support-forum-pc-version.12">Assetto Corsa</a>
is a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/244210/Assetto_Corsa/">Steam</a> "game",
which when launched for Odyssey+ also runs SteamVR and WMR portal.<br>
The game runs fine with TH8A shift and G29 wheel and pedals, when displaying on a monitor.<br>
When Options->Video->Rendering Mode set from Single Screen to OpenVr,<br>
then starting Drive launchs WMR portal and SteamVR, but loses TH8A and G29 controls.<br>
Within Drive, the pit menu usually appears, but disappears once driving, and Esc does not work,<br>
so unable to e.g. gracefully exit or return to pit.<br>
This may be SteamVR expecting inputs from a game controller..<br>
<br>
Instead, what works: Install <a href="contentmgr.htm">Content Manager</a>  in Steam and launch from <a href="steam://open/console">there</a>.<br>
Customize mouse Forward and Back buttons to [Ctrl + space bar] and [Esc] keystrokes, respectively, e.g. using Logitech SetPoint Settings.<br>

Sim driving by VR HMD means not seeing physical controls,
unless video capture of controls is reinserted in 3D view,<br>
without which controls on steering wheel are IMO useless, simplifying direct drive options.<br>
<a href="https://www.simxperience.com/en-us/products/accessories/accuforcesteering.aspx">AccuForce</a> has a good reputation, with $599

They also sell a $28.50 <a href="https://www.ricmotech.com/Mounting_Bracket_for_SimLab_Heusinkveld_Chassis_p/rmt-ddaf-slabadpt.htm"> front mounting

<h3>SimLab TR1 Chassis
<img align=top src="https://sim-lab.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/TR105-e1533415335250-100x100.jpg"></h3>
I like the overall <a href="https://sim-lab.eu/product/teamredline-tr1-chassis/">cockpit</a> design:
<img align=center src="https://sim-lab.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/TR109-100x100.jpg">
except for being black, back-ordered and 412 Euros + shipping.
<br>
The 350 Euro <a href="https://simetik.com/web/product/k2-cockpit/">Simetek K2-R</a> seems similar, except not (much) 80/20<br>
Adding their proprietary and optional shifter mount, etc, quickly increases the price.<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMSaH1g0uE">This video</a> shows an AccuForce being mounted to a K2-R,<br>
with close-up of AccuForce base plate at 14:00/15.16.<br>
<br>
Sim and VR components want proximity to PC for USB, making a DD-capable wheel stand seem more practical.<br>
The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HM6DR81">$160 GT Omega APEX wheel stand</a> did OK in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5OPW20iTN0">video with a DD1 at 20nm</a>.<br>
Discount code <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twy1wSq6IHA">DAN</a> for 5% off at <a href="https://www.gtomega.com/products/apex-steering-wheel-stand">gtomega.com</a>, where they are $150 on preorder.<br>
