<h4>Intro</h4>
<details>
<summary><i>your mileage may vary</i> <code>[click for details]</code></summary>
Niels Heusinkveld, owner of the <a href="https://heusinkveld.com/">sim pedal company</a>,
described his first <code>real</code> track experience:<br>
<iframe align=center width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ExJEGp9itHE"></iframe><br>
I was struck by his lack of appreciation for inertial forces,<br>
although he certainly noted tail-wagging from too much throttle out of wet corners.<br>
As a 20-year sim racer, Niels is used to mostly depending on visual cues,<br>
not to mention (although he did) less precision in real pedals than his sim pedal products<br>
and lack of weight and feedback from real power steering.<br>
He reported a somewhat sore neck from roughly 1-G lateral acceleration,<br>
while depending mostly on visual cues and control feedback, rather than G-forces.<br>
He was surprised about understeer with relatively small slip and steering angles.<br>
He was unaware where he looked on track, contrasted to awareness of bezels with triple screens.<br>
While he was aware of e.g. the rear stepping out, that seemed mostly from change of view.<br>
Compared to sim, "real life was wrong".<ul compact>
<li>Tired synchros made real shifts notably slower
<li>Feeling buttock G forces was not a revelation
<li>seat feel did not add a dimension
<li>slides were mostly noted visually
<li>Sounds and smells were annoying and distracting
<li>Sense of speed was similar
<li>The bug did not bite; sim comfort and convenience are preferred</ul>

By comparison, I am relatively unused to depending on feedback from controls<br>
and probably more than most "real" drivers used to depending on G forces<br>
and relatively less on vision, presumably because lacking confidence in depth perception,<br>
since my vision did not fuse until I was in my mid-40s. &nbsp Consequently,<br>
I need <i>more practice</i> to learn feedback from controls and ShakeSeat.<br>
Odyssey+ image sharpness is probably not enough to instill real confidence,<br>
particularly since VR resolution is best in the center, but wants far focus<br>
which my trifocal eyeglasses cannot provide.<br>
<br>

G-force unlearning / relearning issues: 4:15/15:48 &nbsp
<iframe align=center width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XjcW3qzWTyE"></iframe><br>
<br>
FWIW, I expect professional and better amateur drivers will generally adapt more quickly between sim and real racing,<br>
since G-forces differ so much between street and many race cars.<br>
<br>
This is also biased towards streetable BMWs with power steering and brakes,<br>
minimal aero and enough mods to be pleasant on track, but far from real racing cars.<br>
Consequently, neither brutally stiff brake pedals nor massive steering effort are goals.

<br>
I suppose there are drivers who can jump into a car new to them, drive out onto a circuit new to them,<br>
and turn in competitive times within a few laps.  Further, some individuals seemingly can<br>
jump into unfamiliar driving simulation programs and quickly become comfortable<br>
using rudimentary controls with minimal instruction and tweaking.<br>
The following is <i><b>not</b></i> for you. &nbsp Instead, this is for tweakers and incrementalists..<br>

Miserably documented and barely supported (sold only in the U.S.)<br>
wants to install HMD Odyssey Home on C:<br>
.. but not enough space<br>
<br>
Plugging in launched Mixed Reality Portal,<br>
which reported that HMD was sleeping, but [wake] button would not..<br>
Eventually, things started happening.<br>
I have no idea how anyone is supposed to navigate WMR portal outhouse.<br>
Going into Windows 10 Start menu revealed both<br>

<br>
I uninstalled 'Samsung HMD Odyssey Setup'...<br>
<br>
Launching 'Samsung HMD Odyssey+ Setup',<br>
it prompted to install firmware version 1.0.2;<br>
having read of problems,<br>
I first killed Mixed Reality Portal, then update succeeded.<br>
<br>
One screen 'Get to know your controller' provided names for 6 controls,<br>

<br>
Without HMD, used mouse to launch SteamVR,<br>

<summary><code>[click for installation details]</code></summary>
<pre>
15 Apr 2018 - bought Assetto Corsa from Steam;
had to reboot to resolve error after installation.
After splash screens, no idea what to do;
there had been some brief message about keys to press,
but I missed whatever it said.

Assetto Corsa packages (base $20)
Ultimate bundle $40 (but wait for a sale)
Dream pack 1 $7 - Alfa GTA, Nurburgring-Nordschleife
others seem less interesting to me...

Assetto Corsa content takes a lot of space;
mods cannot be added to ~\Documents\Assetto Corsa\
https://steamcommunity.com/app/244210/discussions/0/619568793783231679/

Moved that folder from SSD && created a <JUNCTION>:
mklink /J "C:\Users\bleke\Documents\Assetto Corsa" "G:\Gateway\my\Assetto Corsa"

Used Steam to change default content directory to G:\Gateway\my\Steam\
... and also created Assetto Corsa backup there.

Steam folder in Program Files is 867MB without Assetto Corsa
Assetto Corsa folder is 24.4GB

In Steam app, under LIBRARY dropdown, select GAMES, right-click
Assetto Corsa > Properties > LOCAL FILES dropdown >MOVE INSTALL FOLDER..

<a name=tuning><h5>Tuning</h5></a>
Once parts are sorted, learning to use them generally works better taken incrementally.<br>
Learning a new track in a car with unknown behaviors using controls that respond unexpectedly<br>
can be frustrating, off-putting and inefficient.<br>
To mitigate information overload, seriously consider first driving a skid pad, then a figure 8.<br>
Assetto Corsa included neither of those in its offering, but mod tracks are available:<br>
<a href="https://www.assettocorsa.net/forum/index.php#assetto-corsa-support-forum-pc-version.12">Assetto Corsa</a>
is a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/244210/Assetto_Corsa/">Steam</a> "game",
which when launched for Odyssey+ also runs SteamVR and WMR portal.<br>
The game runs fine with TH8A shift and G29 wheel and pedals, when displaying on a monitor.<br>
When Options->Video->Rendering Mode set from Single Screen to OpenVR,<br>
then starting Drive launched WMR portal and SteamVR, but lost TH8A and G29 controls.<br>
Within Drive, the pit menu appears, but disappears once driving.<br>
Esc does not work while pit menu is active, so unable to e.g. gracefully exit.<br>
<br>
Instead, what works: Install <a href="#contentmgr">Content Manager</a> in Steam and launch from <a href="steam://open/console">there</a>.<br>
Customize mouse Forward and Back buttons to [Ctrl + space bar] and [Esc] keystrokes, respectively,<br>
 e.g. using <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/articles/11650">Logitech SetPoint Settings</a>.<br>

<a name=pedals><h3>G29 pedal mods</h3></a>
<h4> Problems</h4>
Lacking inertial cues from braking velocity changes, sim racing seems harder than real.<br>
Although Logitech improved pedal <i>feel</i> with their G29, braking control remains problematic:,<ul compact>
<li> signal to sim software is based on pedal movement distance, not pressure.
<li> feedback, if any, for tires losing grip during braking currently comes thru the steering wheel,
instead of the brake pedal.</ul>


<h4>Project</h4>
Brake simulation shortcomings can be mitigated by:<ul compact>
<li> replacing brake potentiometer with a [load cell](https://imgur.com/gallery/gOjAf)<ul compact>
<li>That mod uses analog op amp, problematic with Logitech's brake curve, but fine with AccuForce</ul>
<li> simulating ABS feedback at the brake pedal
<li>e.g. @ 3:47/10:56 of this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aLqqcEaUVk">DIY RUMBLE PEDALS SIM RACING</a><ul compact>
<li>Get tire slip data from Assetto Corsa via SimHub, which can drive <a href="https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki#custom-serial-devices-support">Custom serial devices</a>
</ul>
<li>Far easier to use <a href="https://www.daytonaudio.com/product/1180/daex32ep-4-thruster-32mm-exciter-40w-4-ohm">an exciter</a> via <a href="https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/ShakeIt-V3-Bass-Shakers---Audio-Output-Configuration">SimHub ShakeIt</a></ul>
<br>

<i>Jan 16, 2021</i><br>
G29 brake pedal rumble motor was uncompelling:&nbsp <img align=top src="rumblepedal.jpg"><br>
Finally received Dayton Thruster for brake pedal shake:<br>
<img src="Dayton.jpg"><br clear=all>
Piezo contact mic sensor temporarily hot-glued for <a href="haptic.htm">haptic measurement exercises</a>.<br>
<br>
Thruster attaches by pressure-sensitive adhesive, best used only once. &nbsp <img src="3M.jpg"><br>
The center brake pad screw hole was usurped to mount the Thruster:&nbsp <img src="ThrusterScrew.jpg"><br>
A longer screw matching the G29 pedal mount threads was located and screwed just far enough to barely protrude: &nbsp <img src="screw.jpg"><br>
Thrusters ideally want rigid, non-resonant but fairly light mounts; a scrap of polymer-coated 10mm MDF was sourced.<br>
Thruster mount scratched by mounting screw:&nbsp <img src="scratch.jpg"><br>
Brake pedal pad reinstalled offset right, facilitating heel/toe:&nbsp <img src="offsetBrake.jpg"><br>
For Thruster clearance, mount must be off-center. Screw hole was counter-bored, large enough for socket so that nut could be recessed. &nbsp <img src="recessed.jpg"><br>
Mount will be cleaned with Windex and wiped dry to promote bonding to Thruster's 3M adhesive. &nbsp <img src="offset.jpg"<br clear=all>
<br>
Properly applied, hot glue bonds well enough to peel piezo off their metal discs; ask how I know. &nbsp <img src="piezo_damage.jpg"><br clear=all>
Obtaining that bond consistently is difficult, and hot glue's resilience is not ideal for capturing vibration energy,<br>
Consequently, two-part epoxy is a better choice for bonding piezo pairs and mass-loading.<br>

<h3>SRS ShakeSeat, SimXperience Sim Commander SimVibe and Aurora R7 Windows 10 sound</h3></a>
Home sim driving rigs cannot realistically simulate cornering and braking G's;<br>
better to <a href="haptic.htm">more cost-effective haptic feedbacks</a>.<br>
Niels Heusinkveld <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebZS1b4viYk">agrees (1:-2:/11:44)</a><br>
When cornering limits are exceeded, G29 wheel seems to go into 'slow motion', making spins unrecoverable.<br>
Assetto Corsa physics software overwhelming Gateway i5 was originally suspected,<br>
but it still happens with Aurora i7, so perhaps G29 is  being overwhelmed by too much I/O.<br>
Perhaps diverting appropriate feedback from G29 to other haptics would help,<br>
leaving only those that actually help steer..<br>
<br>

Many serious sim racers use sim racing chassis, with actuators at 4 corners.<br>
Sim Racing Studio's
<a href="https://www.simracingstudio.com/product-page/srs-shakekit-shakeseat-integrated-with-shakebox-lite">$250 ShakeKit</a>,
comprised of <a href="https://www.simracingstudio.com/product-page/srs-license">software</a>, USB soundcard, amplifiers,<br>
and 4 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0045W10VW">Dayton bass shaker pucks</a> in a thinly padded seat cushion.<br>
That <a href="https://www.simracingstudio.com/product-page/srs-shakeseat">ShakeSeat cushion</a> is available separately for about half the cost. &nbsp
<a href="http://simracinggarage.com/sim-racing-studio-shakekit-review"><br>

"Probably the easiest way for you to get<br> a proper feeling transducer solution deployed on your Sim Racing setup."<br>

Debugged the above and wired a matching bulkhead connector via 6 ft zip cord<br>
to a couple of mismatched  amplifiers, one with an FM tuner,<br>
so fed an FM station to the rear pair of ShakeSeat pucks.<br>
Sound is surprisingly intelligible and the feel is at least not unpleasant.<br>
Can easily distinguish left from right, then blending nicely<br>
when fed equal amounts of monaural sound,<br>
so left rear vs right rear vs both rear should be useful cues.<br>

<a name=pad><h4>[dis]comfort</h4></a>
As a frequent bike rider, my butt is not particularly tender,<br>
but sitting on four hard pucks for hours will be unpleasant,<br>
and the soft foam used by Sim Racing Studio does little to spread the pressure.<br>

A pioneer in converting sim telemetry to bass shaker audio,<br>
that is now also available from (free) SimHub as well as SRS' ShakeKit.<br>
SimXperience has since integrated SimVibe with
<a href="https://www.simxperience.com/en-us/products/software/simcommander4.aspx">Sim Commander 4</a>,<br>
which also drives their <a href="#DD">AccuForce direct drive steering wheel</a> (<i>on order</i>).<br>
<br>
SimXperience warns that multiple identical sound adapters can be problematic.<br>
Both Aurora motherboard and Samsung Odyssey+ sound identify as Realtek:<br>
Intel and NVIDIA audio are presumably about HDMI. &nbsp Despite nomenclature,<br>
Windows 10 Sound Blaster X-Fi support appears to be only stereo.<br>
Realtek motherboard audio is enabled only after plugging into 1/8 phone jacks.<br>
Realtek USB2.0 device disappears when Odyssey+ HMD sleeps,<br>
reportedly confusing SimVibe/Sim Commander 4 (SC4),<br>
which evidently keys off sequence in list of available devices.<br>
Since Assetto Corsa already loses access to G29 and TH8A<br>
unless launched <b>after</b> Steam and Content Manager,<br>
inserting SC4 launch may also be problematic.<br>
<img src="AudioDevices.png"><br clear=all>
<br>
"You have to select the audio-source in SC4 while the Odyssey is running."<br>
Then launch SC4 after SteamVR and activate the profile last, so don't launch games with SC4.<br>
I would prefer a fix, but once you got used to it, it's not a game-breaker,<br>
because in window-mode you can launch SC4 while the game is loading.<br>
If the headset falls to sleep mode, the output in SC4 is dead and you need to re-launch it the next time.<br>

<br>
The first bullet for Sim Commander 4: "Simple To Use"<br>
https://simxperience.com/en-us/products/software/simcommander4.aspx<br>
* if true, users would notice without it being pointed out.<br>
* as is nearly always the case, emphatically untrue,<br>
if "use" means anything other than launching a default<br>
or something useful [but painfully] configured and debugged..<br>
* Consider it a fair warning that, on the same page, Tutorials require Flash.<br>
- first (for installation) should be skipped - applied to SC3 and is flat misleading<br>
- second may be still somewhat relevant, but requires much homework to correctly fill blanks<br>
- last SimVibe could be valuable, if still accurate<br>
<br>
At least on my Windows 10 64-bit Home PC,<br>
pop-up windows essential to Sim Commander 4 installation were hidden beneath<br>
the main setup window, resulting in no progress until raised from the taskbar.<br>
<br>
Sim Commander license code displayed online was truncated;<br>
fortunately, gif was fully visible after download (to USB1TB/Sim).<br>
After initial setup, Sim Commander splash window plays obnoxious drum solo,<br>
which can be stifled by clearing Background Music in Control Center.<br>
<br>
Rerunning Auto Search found Assetto Corsa, but not games in <code>E:\my\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common</code><br>
.. which were added manually, but still do not show up on SC4 splash screen.<br>
REALLY need to find getting started documentation!!<br>
<br>
Configuring SC2 launch by Content Manager was doomed;<br>
no Output Mixer and seemingly no ShakeSeat output.<br>
<br>
This was cured by adding a fresh Sim Commander profile<br>
(using big + at bottom of main screen) and selecting Assetto Corsa,<br>
then duplicating and changing game to Content Manager.<br>
After that, even the original Content Manager profile has an Output Mixer...<br>
<br>
SimVibe Tuning guide https://simxperience.com/Portals/0/Files/SimVibe/SimVibe%20Tuning%20Guide.pdf<br>
<br>
SimVibe chassis appears to support neither traction loss nor ABS,<br>
but has estimated wheel lockup (mono), oversteer and "custom simvibe effect"<br>
<br>
Good news: switching from single screen to openvr in Content Manager<br>
launched from SC4 did not lose SimVib, but did lose remapped mouse buttons<br>
until logging out and back in, then launching CM from steam,<br>
THEN launching (really, just attaching) CM/AC from SC4,<br>
at which point SimVib and mouse buttons both worked.<br>
<br>
Somehow overnight, SC4 loses all profilesexcept Forza 7 and AC from scratch..?<br>
<br>
SC4 still launches a useless black abomination that is presumably its so-called Dashboard<br>
<br>
After fiddling with Sim Commander 4 SimVibe<br>
* it is more about simulating road feel than haptics feedback to help drive<br>
* documentation sucks and effect names are unhelpful<br>

<h4><a name="Simshakeseat">SimHub for ShakeSeat: G-force modulated 4 corner tire slip</a></h4>
Background and disclaimers<br>
My sim driving experience is only with Assetto Corsa, an office chair and wheel stand.<br>
I have no experience with the
<a href="https://www.simracingstudio.com/product-page/srs-shakekit-shakeseat-integrated-with-shakebox-lite">full SRS ShakeKit</a>,
which may offer a superior experience.<br>
Without a harness to keep one's back contacting them, back transducers in
<a href="https://www.simracingstudio.com/product-page/srs-shakekit-plus-includes-srs-license-for-bass-shaker">ShakeKit Plus</a> seem of arguable benefit.<br>
<br>
Already using SimHub, having unused motherboard 7.1 sound and obsolete Denon surround receiver,<br>
 a ShakeSeat pad was ordered because:<br>
* <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlJfIFhdk1c&t=306s">Sim Racing Garage review</a><br>
* Dayton TT25-16 pucks were, at the time, in short supply elsewhere<br>
An equivalent <a href="#pad">can be made</a> using Dayton pucks with e.g.<br>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GZFJ1CN">40cm square zippered cushion covers</a>
and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B012TWTUMU">EVA foam floor tiles</a><br>

Standard SimHub ShakeIt tire slip does not consider tire loading.<br>
For example, an inside tire may be fully unloaded during cornering,<br>
so very high slippage, but no perceived sensation in actual driving.<br>
<br>
This attempts to approximate track sensations from street tires,<br>
when securely harnessed in a fitted racing seat.<br>
Usefulness of such haptic feedback may vary widely among users<br>
* e.g.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExJEGp9itHE&t=3550s">Niels Heusinkveld
indicated that seat feel is overrated</a><br>
&nbsp .. and he cued more visually off horizon movement.<br>
IMO, this feedback is less compelling than that from
<a href="https://www.racedepartment.com/threads/2dof-harness-tensionner-with-fly-ptmover.194331/">2DOF harness tensioners</a>,<br>
but reduces a sense of "something missing".<br>
<br>
Unambiguously directional haptic cues seemingly involve substantially direct stimulation of<br>
body parts, e.g. left and right thighs, lumbars and/or sit bones.<br>
<img src="SRS_EVA.jpg"><br clear=all>
Sensations to be simulated here:<br>
squeal for small slippage, transitioning to moaning with more slippage,
then shuddering near breakaway,<br>
with much less feeling from lightly loaded tires
(rear when braking, inside when cornering).<br>
<br>
Implementation replaces SimHub Wheels slip effect with a pair of Custom Effects<br>
1. latitudinal and longitudinal acceleration properties<br>
2. loaded tire slips, products of tire slip properties times accelerations<br>
<br>
<a name=accel>Accelerations</a> are estimated from changes in speed and yaw samples and serve as G force proxies.<br>
Earlier SimHub versions sampled speed and yaw slower than Assetto Corsa sample updates,<br>
resulting in some changes 2x others, which code here detects and mitigates.<br>
<br>
Left channel <b>Lateral G-force proxy</b>:<pre><code>// lateral acceleration proxy
var y = $prop('OrientationYaw');
const tc = 3;  // IIR smoothing factor
const noise = 0.01 // non-linear filter threshold

// initialize IIR filter history
if(null==root["yaw"]) {
   root["yaw"] = $prop('OrientationYaw');
   root["delta_y"] = 0.2;
}
if (null==root["Gyb4"])
  root["Gyb4"] = 0.5;

var dy = y - root["yaw"];       // change between sample intervals

// yaw flips at +/- 180
if (Math.abs(dy) > 180) {  // yaw went +/- 180
  if (Math.abs(root["yaw"]) > 150)
    dy = -(y + root["yaw"]);
}

root["yaw"] = y;
y = root["delta_y"];    // previous sample change

// mitigate delta spikes from missed samples
var my = 1;     // sample interval
if ((Math.abs(dy * y) > noise)  // missed sample?
 && (Math.abs(dy) > Math.abs(1.8 * y)))
  dy /= (my = 2);

root["delta_y"] = dy;

// IIR low-pass filter
var Gyb4 = root["Gyb4"];        // IIR output
Gyb4 += my * (dy - Gyb4) / tc;  // low-pass IIR
root["Gyb4"] = Gyb4;
return 50 + (50 * Gyb4);  // range 0-100
// 50 corresponds to no G force</code></pre>
<b>Longitudinal acceleration</b> (right channel) is similar, substituting speed for yaw<br>
<br>
<b>Loaded tire slip corner effects</b> use products of tire slips and G force proxies:
<pre><code>return .01*$prop('GameRawData.Physics.WheelSlip01')*($prop('ShakeITBSV3Plugin.Export.proxy_G.Left'))*(90-$prop('ShakeITBSV3Plugin.Export.proxy_G.Right'))
// since this multiplies two properties with 0-100 ranges,
// results must be reduced by 100 to return the same range
// left vs right G-force distributions are applied to wheel slips
//  by (proxy_G.Left) and (100-proxy_G.Left),
// while front-to-rear G-force distributions are by
//  ( proxy_G.Right-10) vs (90- proxy_G.Right)
// to reflect that, while inner wheels may become fully unloaded in corners,
// track cars are expected to fully unload neither nor rear wheels
</code></pre>
These two CUSTOM EFFECTS could be combined,<br>
except that G-force proxy properties are also used by a Custom serial device for <a href="#SimHarness">2DOF harness tensioning</a>.<br>

Refurbished Logitech G29 arrived April 2018<br>
seemingly unblemished with original contents and dividers in unoriginal plain brown box.<br>
Single sheet of instructions (one side) of inaccurate diagrams<br>

.. wildly contrasts to TH8A book (8 pages x 18 languages).<br>
Actual URL:<br>
http://support.logitech.com/en_us/product/g29-driving-force<br>
<br>
Downloaded &amp Installed seemingly generic gaming software,<br>
which launched and added itself to Taskbar notifications after reboot.<br>
Launching it was completely uninformative and confusing until after plugging in G29;<br>
before that it seemed to assume there was some backlit keyboard...<br>
Firmware 89.0.25 is up to date.<br>
Set Assetto Corsa profile to be default but not persistent (application can change).<br>
<br>
NOT in instructions:<br>
"You must select your gaming platform before you connect<br>
the G29 racing wheel to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, or PC.<br>
PC: Set the mode switch to PS4.<br>
NOTE: You must install Logitech Gaming Software (LGS) 8.70 or later<br>
on the PC for full functionality. Once you've installed LGS,<br>
all buttons and accessories will function in the games that support them."<ul compact>
<li> Logitech's Gaming Software (LGS) nowhere admits its version,<br>
but filename includes it: <code>LGS_8.98.234X64_Logitech.exe</code><br>

Two G29 wheel issues:<br>
1) small diameter<br>
 &nbsp - probably reasonable for single seater racers...<br>
&nbsp - $25 320mm eBay wheel rotational inertia would likely overwhelm its motors<br>
2) weird feedback, occasional cogging, arbitrary excessive resistance,<br>
