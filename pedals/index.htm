<a name=hmd><h3>Samsung Odyssey+ HMD for WMR</h3></a>
<a href="https://www.assettocorsa.net/forum/index.php#assetto-corsa-support-forum-pc-version.12">Assetto Corsa</a>
is a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/244210/Assetto_Corsa/">Steam</a> "game",
which when launched for Odyssey+ also runs SteamVR and WMR portal.<br>
The game runs fine with TH8A shift and G29 wheel and pedals, when displaying on a monitor.<br>
When Options->Video->Rendering Mode set from Single Screen to OpenVr,<br>
then starting Drive launchs WMR portal and SteamVR, but loses TH8A and G29 controls.<br>
Within Drive, the pit menu usually appears, but disappears once driving, and Esc does not work,<br>
so unable to e.g. gracefully exit or return to pit.<br>
This may be SteamVR expecting inputs from a game controller..<br>
<br>
Instead, what works: Install <a href="contentmgr.htm">Content Manager</a>  in Steam and launch from <a href="steam://open/console">there</a>.<br>
Customize mouse Forward and Back buttons to [Ctrl + space bar] and [Esc] keystrokes, respectively, e.g. using Logitech SetPoint Settings.<br>

<br>

For example, no video watched so far recommends downloading new mods <i>within Content Manager</i><br>
&nbsp by clicking <code>CONTENT</code> in the top bar, then <b>get new mods</b>, perhaps because <b><i>those downloads fail</i></b>...<br>
Instead, use <a href="https://www.racedepartment.com/threads/how-to-use-content-manager-to-load-cars-skins-into-ac.159093/#post-2823684">BuntqF's CM setup</a>

<h3>SRS ShakeSeat, SimXperience SimCommander and Aurora R7 Windows 10 sound</h3></a>
Home sim driving rigs cannot realistically simulate cornering and braking G's;<br>
better to more cost-effective haptic feedbacks.<br>
When cornering limits are exceeded, G29 wheel seems to go into 'slow motion', making spins unrecoverable.<br>
Assetto Corsa physics software overwhelming Gateway i5 was originally suspected,<br>
but it still happens with Aurora i7, so perhaps G29 is  being overwhelmed by too much I/O.<br>
Perhaps diverting appropriate feedback from G29 to other haptics will help,<br>
leaving only those that actually help steer..<br>
<br>
Many serious sim racers use sim racing chassis, with actuators at 4 corners.<br>
Sim Racing Studio offers a
<a href="https://www.simracingstudio.com/product-page/srs-shakekit-shakeseat-integrated-with-shakebox-lite">$250 ShakeKit</a>,
comprised of <a href="https://www.simracingstudio.com/product-page/srs-license">software</a>, USB soundcard, amplifiers,<br>
and 4 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0045W10VW">Dayton bass shaker pucks</a> in a thinly padded seat cushion.<br>
That <a href="https://www.simracingstudio.com/product-page/srs-shakeseat">ShakeSeat cushion</a> is available separately for about half the cost. &nbsp
<a href="http://simracinggarage.com/sim-racing-studio-shakekit-review">
Barry Rowland</a> considers the ShakeKit:<br>
"Probably the easiest way for you to get a proper feeling transducer solution deployed on your Sim Racing setup."<br>

Confusingly, <a href="https://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/shakeit-diy-rumble-feedback-for-assettocorsa-codmasters-pcars-rf1-rf2-iracing.13563/updates">ShakeIt</a>
(one less K) is/was free software, since integrated into <a href="https://www.simhubdash.com/">SimHub</a>, equivalent to SRS'.<br>
My Aurora R7 has unused 7.1 channel audio on the motherboard,
and audio amplifiers were also on hand.<br>
<a href="https://www.simxperience.com/Products/SimVibe/SimVibeSoftware.aspx">SimXperience SimVibe</a>
was a pioneer in converting sim telemetry to bass shaker audio<br>
now also available from (free) SimHub as well as SRS' ShakeKit.<br>
SimXperience has since
integrated SimVibe with <a href="https://www.simxperience.com/en-us/products/software/simcommander4.aspx">Sim Commander 4</a>,<br>
which also drives their <a href="">AccuForce direct drive steering wheel</a> (<i>on order</i>).<br>
<br>
SimXperience warns that multiple identical sound adapters can be problematic.<br>
Both Aurora motherboard and Samsung Odyssey+ sound identify as Realtek:<br>
Intel and NVIDIA audio are presumably about HDMI. &nbsp Despite nomenclature,<br>
Windows 10 Sound Blaster X-Fi support appears to be only stereo.<br>
Realtek motherboard audio is enabled only after plugging into 1/8 phone jacks.<br>
Realtek USB2.0 device disappears when Odyssey+ HMD sleeps,<br>
reportedly confusing SimVibe/Sim Commander 4 (SC4),<br>
which evidently keys off sequence in list of available devices.<br>
Since Assetto Corsa already loses access to G29 and TH8A<br>
unless launched <b>after</b> Steam and Content Manager,<br>
inserting SC4 launch may also be problematic.<br>

<h4>[dis]comfort</h4>
As a frequent bike rider, my butt is not particularly tender,<br>
but sitting on four hard pucks for hours will be unpleasant,<br>
and the soft foam used by Sim Racing Studio does little to spread the pressure.<br>

Sim driving by VR HMD means not seeing physical controls,
