Niels Heusinkveld, owner of the <a href="https://heusinkveld.com/">sim pedal company</a>,
described his first <code>real</code> track experience:<br>
<iframe align=center width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ExJEGp9itHE"></iframe><br>
I was struck by his lack of appreciation for inertial forces,<br>
although he certainly noted tail-wagging from too much throttle out of wet corners.<br>
As a 20-year sim racer, Niels is used to mostly depending on visual cues,<br>
not to mention (although he did) less precision in real pedals than his sim pedal products<br>
and lack of weight and feedback from real power steering.<br>
He reported a somewhat sore neck from roughly 1-G lateral acceleration,<br>
while depending mostly on visual cues and control feedback, rather than G-forces.<br>
He was surprised about understeer with relatively small slip and steering angles.<br>
He was unaware where he looked on track, contrasted to awareness of bezels with triple screens.<br>
While he was aware of e.g. the rear stepping out, that seemed mostly from change of view.<br>
Compared to sim, "real life was wrong".<ul compact>
<li>Tired synchros made real shifts notably slower
<li>Feeling buttock G forces was not a revelation
<li>seat feel did not add a dimension
<li>slides were mostly noted visually
<li>Sounds and smells were annoying and distracting
<li>Sense of speed was similar
<li>The bug did not bite; sim comfort and convenience are preferred</ul>

By comparison, I am relatively unused to depending on feedback from controls<br>
and probably more than most "real" drivers used to depending on G forces<br>
and relatively less on vision, presumably because lacking confidence in depth perception,<br>
since my vision did not fuse until I was in my mid-40s. &nbsp Consequently,<br>
I need <i>more practice</i> to learn feedback from controls and ShakeSeat.<br>
Odyssey+ image sharpness is probably not enough to instill real confidence,<br>
particularly since VR resolution is best in the center, but wants far focus<br>
which my trifocal eyeglasses cannot provide.<br>
<br>
This video by another sim driver with previous track experience and consequential<br>
G-force unlearning / relearning issues: 4:15/15:48 &nbsp
<iframe align=center width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XjcW3qzWTyE"></iframe><br>
<br>
FWIW, I expect professional and better amateur drivers will generally adapt more quickly between sim and real racing,<br>
since G-forces differ so much between street and many race cars.<br>
<br>
This is also biased towards streetable BMWs with power steering and brakes,<br>
minimal aero and enough mods to be pleasant on track, but far from real racing cars.<br>
Consequently, neither brutally stiff brake pedals nor massive steering effort are goals.

Refurbished Logitech G29 arrived;<br>
seemingly unblemished with original contents and dividers in unoriginal plain brown box.<br>
Single sheet of instructions (one side) of inaccurate diagrams<br>
and URL: www.logitech.com/support/g29<br>
.. wildly contrasts to TH8A book (8 pages x 18 languages).<br>
Actual URL:<br>
http://support.logitech.com/en_us/product/g29-driving-force<br>
<br>
Downloaded &amp Installed seemingly generic gaming software,<br>
which launched and added itself to Taskbar notifications after reboot.<br>
Launching it was completely uninformative and confusing until after plugging in G29;<br>
before that it seemed to assume there was some backlit keyboard...<br>
Firmware 89.0.25 is up to date.<br>
Set Assetto Corsa profile to be default but not persistent (application can change).<br>
<br>
NOT in instructions:<br>
"You must select your gaming platform before you connect<br>
the G29 racing wheel to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, or PC.<br>
PC: Set the mode switch to PS4.<br>
NOTE: You must install Logitech Gaming Software (LGS) 8.70 or later<br>
on the PC for full functionality. Once you've installed LGS, all buttons<br>
and accessories will function in the games that support them."<br>
<br>
* Logitech's Gaming Software (LGS) nowhere admits its version,<br>
 but filename includes it: LGS_8.98.234X64_Logitech.exe<br>
* Undocumented icon for Overwolf, which evidently defies explanation:<br>
 https://www.overwolf.com/about-overwolf/<br>
* LGS documentation avoids device-specific information;<br>
 ends up being mostly useless..<br>

Bottom line:<br>
Settings icon has Profile tab (which I set to default Assetto Corsa),<br>
G29 tab (which I allowed Game to adjust force settings),<br>
<br>

<h5>Samsung HMD Odyssey+</h5>
Miserably documented and barely supported (sold only in the U.S.)<br>
wants to install HMD Odyssey Home on C:<br>
.. but not enough space<br>
<br>
Plugging in launched Mixed Reality Portal,<br>
which reported that HMD was sleeping, but [wake] button would not..<br>
Eventually, things started happening.<br>
I have no idea how anyone is supposed to navigate WMR portal outhouse.<br>
Going into Windows 10 Start menu revealed both<br>
<code>Samsung HMD Odyssey Setup<br>

<br>
3D Viewer was installed<br>
360 Viewer was installed<br>
<br>
I uninstalled 'Samsung HMD Odyssey Setup'...<br>
<br>
Launching 'Samsung HMD Odyssey+ Setup',<br>
it prompted to install firmware version 1.0.2;<br>
having read of problems,<br>
I first killed Mixed Reality Portal, then update succeeded.<br>
<br>
One screen 'Get to know your controller' provided names for 6 controls,<br>

<h5>Assetto Corsa</h5>
<a href="https://www.assettocorsa.net/forum/index.php#assetto-corsa-support-forum-pc-version.12">Assetto Corsa</a>
is a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/244210/Assetto_Corsa/">Steam</a> "game",
which when launched for Odyssey+ also runs SteamVR and WMR portal.<br>
The game runs fine with TH8A shift and G29 wheel and pedals, when displaying on a monitor.<br>
When Options->Video->Rendering Mode set from Single Screen to OpenVr,<br>
then starting Drive launched WMR portal and SteamVR, but lost TH8A and G29 controls.<br>
Within Drive, the pit menu appears, but disappears once driving.
Esc does not work while pit menu is active, so unable to e.g. gracefully exit.<br>
<br>
Instead, what works: Install <a href="#contentmgr">Content Manager</a> in Steam and launch from <a href="steam://open/console">there</a>.<br>
Customize mouse Forward and Back buttons to [Ctrl + space bar] and [Esc] keystrokes, respectively, e.g. using <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/articles/11650">Logitech SetPoint Settings</a>.<br>

<h3>SRS ShakeSeat, SimXperience SimCommander and Aurora R7 Windows 10 sound</h3></a>
Home sim driving rigs cannot realistically simulate cornering and braking G's;<br>
better to more cost-effective haptic feedbacks.<br>
When cornering limits are exceeded, G29 wheel seems to go into 'slow motion', making spins unrecoverable.<br>
Assetto Corsa physics software overwhelming Gateway i5 was originally suspected,<br>
but it still happens with Aurora i7, so perhaps G29 is  being overwhelmed by too much I/O.<br>
Perhaps diverting appropriate feedback from G29 to other haptics will help,<br>
leaving only those that actually help steer..<br>

Many serious sim racers use sim racing chassis, with actuators at 4 corners.<br>
Sim Racing Studio's
<a href="https://www.simracingstudio.com/product-page/srs-shakekit-shakeseat-integrated-with-shakebox-lite">$250 ShakeKit</a>,
comprised of <a href="https://www.simracingstudio.com/product-page/srs-license">software</a>, USB soundcard, amplifiers,<br>
and 4 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0045W10VW">Dayton bass shaker pucks</a> in a thinly padded seat cushion.<br>
That <a href="https://www.simracingstudio.com/product-page/srs-shakeseat">ShakeSeat cushion</a> is available separately for about half the cost. &nbsp
<a href="http://simracinggarage.com/sim-racing-studio-shakekit-review">
Barry Rowland</a> considers the ShakeKit:<br>
"Probably the easiest way for you to get a proper feeling transducer solution deployed on your Sim Racing setup."<br>

Confusingly, <a href="https://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/shakeit-diy-rumble-feedback-for-assettocorsa-codmasters-pcars-rf1-rf2-iracing.13563/updates">ShakeIt</a>
(one less K) is/was free software, since integrated into <a href="https://www.simhubdash.com/">SimHub</a>, equivalent to SRS'.<br>
My Aurora R7 has unused 7.1 channel audio on the motherboard,
and audio amplifiers were also on hand.<br>
<a href="https://www.simxperience.com/Products/SimVibe/SimVibeSoftware.aspx">SimXperience SimVibe</a>
was a pioneer in converting sim telemetry to bass shaker audio<br>
now also available from (free) SimHub as well as SRS' ShakeKit.<br>
SimXperience has since
integrated SimVibe with <a href="https://www.simxperience.com/en-us/products/software/simcommander4.aspx">Sim Commander 4</a>,<br>
which also drives their <a href="">AccuForce direct drive steering wheel</a> (<i>on order</i>).<br>
<br>
SimXperience warns that multiple identical sound adapters can be problematic.<br>
Both Aurora motherboard and Samsung Odyssey+ sound identify as Realtek:<br>
Intel and NVIDIA audio are presumably about HDMI. &nbsp Despite nomenclature,<br>
Windows 10 Sound Blaster X-Fi support appears to be only stereo.<br>
Realtek motherboard audio is enabled only after plugging into 1/8 phone jacks.<br>
Realtek USB2.0 device disappears when Odyssey+ HMD sleeps,<br>
reportedly confusing SimVibe/Sim Commander 4 (SC4),<br>
which evidently keys off sequence in list of available devices.<br>
Since Assetto Corsa already loses access to G29 and TH8A<br>
unless launched <b>after</b> Steam and Content Manager,<br>
inserting SC4 launch may also be problematic.<br>

<h4>[dis]comfort</h4>
As a frequent bike rider, my butt is not particularly tender,<br>
but sitting on four hard pucks for hours will be unpleasant,<br>
and the soft foam used by Sim Racing Studio does little to spread the pressure.<br>

<a name=DD><h3>AccuForce wheel base</h3></a>
Sim driving by VR HMD means not seeing physical controls,
unless video capture of controls is reinserted in 3D view,<br>
without which controls on steering wheel are IMO useless, simplifying direct drive options.<br>

<a name=HOTAS><h3>Hand-On Throttle-And-Stick in SteamVR</h3></a>
Assetto Corsa in Odyssey+ unavoidably involves Windows Mixed Reality Portal and SteamVR,<br>
which support only controllers that I find intolerable<br>
and make no sense when sim driving. Without a controller,<br>
using 2-D apps such as Content Manager in HMD is seemingly impossible,<br>
except perhaps with a virtual desktop app.<br>
G29 rim buttons will be unavailable with AccuForce.<br>
If more than a couple of controller buttons are needed, a flight joystick may be wanted.<br>
