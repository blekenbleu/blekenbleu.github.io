<h2><a href="https://www.simhubdash.com/download-2/">SimHub</a> ShakeIt Bass Shakers</h2>
<a name=ShakeIt>(confusingly,</a> one less K than
<a href="https://www.simracingstudio.com/product-page/srs-shakekit-shakeseat-integrated-with-shakebox-lite">SRS
product</a>) is/was free software,<br>
since integrated into <a href="https://www.simhubdash.com/">SimHub</a>, and somewhat
comparable to <a href="https://www.simracingstudio.com/download">SRS' licensed app</a>.<br>
(<i>Without "Bass Shakers", "SimHub ShakeIt" is about rumble motors.</i>)

<p>Based on game telemetry, SimHub ShakeIt Bass Shakers generates audio signals<br>
which are amplified to power haptic pucks, exciters and shakers.<br>
A SimHub license enables more support..<br>
SimHub ShakeIt used to be
<a href="https://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/shakeit-diy-rumble-feedback-for-assettocorsa-codmasters-pcars-rf1-rf2-iracing.13563/updates">distributed
and supported from RaceDepartment</a>,<br> but no more..<br>
Get SimHub from <a href="http://www.simhubdash.com">http://www.simhubdash.com/</a>
and install per <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwqbx-cA5TE">2Old4Forza's video</a>.</p>

Support is most active on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/299259397060689920/686133283708207260">discord</a>...

<br>
<code>SimHubWPF.exe</code> is neither Steam nor Assetto Corsa app;<br>
it is launched separately, optionally starting with Windows..<br>
It can be configured to launch Content Manager instead of Assetto Corsa

<p>Installed on Aurora @ <code>E:\my\SimHub</code><br>
PayPal'ed license was received promptly and also stored there.<br>
ShakeIt Bass Shakers Output selection required Custom channel map,<br>
moving all [ON] settings from channels 3,4 to 5,6 respectively.<br>
Cannot show all settings at once; cannot drag box height<br>
There are 2 "Advanced output settings", which at least need some context..<br>
Looking at Effects Profile, first selecting a game seems appropriate,<br>
since some say "not supported on the current game",<br>
but effects ideally should be configured for <code>Any Game</code>.</p>

Assetto Corsa configured automatically;<br>
"Game config" seemingly has nothing to do with ShakeIt effect settings..<br>
... except that SimHub remembers what profile was last used for each game<br>
and will switch to that last-used profile when reselecting a game.<br>
New profiles start empty; can add effects one at a time;<br> &emsp; cannot tell if supported until after adding<br>
"Add group" is another minor mystery;&nbsp
<a href="https://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/simhub-shakeit-tactile-effects-multilayer-rpm.40504">here is an example</a>.<br>
Existing effects can be dragged into a group,<br> which can be a convenience for copying effects from one profile to others.<br>
SimHub appears to save settings automagically..<br>

<font size=-1><b>Tactile Immersion - General Discussion - Hardware & Software</b></font></a><br>
Every effect has various controls to manipulate the output: amplitude, frequency, etc.<br>
Both amplitude and frequency can be changed based on the incoming telemetry.<br>
Originally, amplitude could not be changed independently of frequency,<br>&emsp; e.g. for wheel load vs slip.<br>
That motivated a <a href="../MIDI/#plugin">SimHub MIDI plugin</a> to send MIDI based on<br>
 e.g. wheel load to change amplitude of SimHub-generated wheel slip haptic effect.<br>
Effects can be configured as mono, divided front-rear, left-right, or 4-corners.<br>

<li><b>isolation:</b><br>
 &nbsp; When tactile transducers are NOT directly stimulating a sim racer,<br>
 &nbsp; then energy is unavoidably wasted on whatever that transducer is attached.<br>
 &nbsp; So much as possible, such mass should be minimized.<br>
 &nbsp; That typically involves isolating shaken masses from others,<br>
 &nbsp; ideally using underdamped springs, which may be simple elastomer bushings<br>
 &nbsp; or more elaborate spring and damper assemblies, e.g.:<br>
 &nbsp; <a href="https://simtag.shop/gb/accueil/482-racebass-isolators.html"><img src="image/racebass-isolators.jpg"></a><br clear=all>
 &nbsp; ... but in instances where isolated mass (e.g. seat) must also resist forces in some direction,<br>
 &nbsp; then e.g. suspension arms are wanted to resist those forces while isolating tactile energy in other directions.
