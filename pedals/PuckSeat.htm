<h3>PuckSeat:&nbsp DIY ShakeSeat</h3>
SRS no longer offers the original <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SVC7VV2">ShakeKit</a>, which was essentially:<ul>
<li>a 4-channel soundcard and amplifier
<li>four <a href="https://www.daytonaudio.com/product/1104/tt25-8-puck-tactile-transducer-mini-bass-shaker">Dayton TT25-8 pucks</a> and wiring<br><img src=image/pucks.jpg>
<li>a roughly 45cm (18") square cloth zippered seat cushion with skimpy foam padding
</ul><br>
While the following images are from refurbishing <a href="#shakeseat">my ShakeIt cushion</a>, DIY from scratch would be similar.<br>
Issues with first generation ShakeIt cushion modifications:<ul>
<li>Pucks are nearly twice as thick as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001M8MWI2">EVA foam mat</a>
<li>Mat holes did not prevent pucks from wandering</ul><br>

<b>4 years later and wiser</b>:<ol>
<li>Suitable zippered cloth seat cushion covers are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PW88RD1">readily available</a>:<br>
<img width=600 src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61gwLnS4ejL._AC_SL1500_.jpg"><br><br>
<li>Instead of sound card and amplifier, if your PC motherboard has an unused HDMI connector,<br>
consider scrounging a cheap surround receiver with HDMI input (yard sale, thrift shop, ebay),<br>
any of which should be capable of driving 15 Watts per channel to Dayton pucks.<br>
A more powerful pre-HDMI 7.1 receiver, here driven from motherboard audio,<br> enables other channels to drive larger transducers.
<li>Original skimpy SRS padding is nearly dead after 4 years,<br> which will not matter because it no longer needs to provide much padding.<br>
Roll of black drawer cushion (upper right) was not needed.<br>
<img src=image/disassembled.jpg>
<li>Second EVA pad was trimmed slightly smaller than first,<br>with added thickness taking up slack in cloth cover.<br>
Wooden disk will be centered in original EVA pad holes to locate smaller puck faces:<br>
<img src=image/marked.jpg>
<li>serrated steak knife in action:<br><img src=image/stabbed.jpg>
<li>Pucks were hot-glued to EVA mat from the other side,<br> then secured using duct tape on this side.<br>
Note vent holes, which should NOT be blocked by tape.<br><img src=image/fit.jpg>
<li>Larger chunk of original SRS foam was not reused;<br>
4 smaller chunks were hot-glued over larger puck surfaces, which will face up:<br>
<img src=image/tuck.jpg>
<li>ready for reinstallation!<br><img src=image/renewed.jpg>
<li>I did not keep track of original puck assignments (fore/aft, left/right);<br>
reassignment by SimHub channel testing, then reconnecting at amplifier binding posts.

Sim driving rigs cannot realistically simulate cornering and braking G's;<br>
better to employ <a href="haptic.htm">more cost-effective haptic feedbacks</a>.<br>
Niels Heusinkveld <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebZS1b4viYk?t=115s">agrees (1:55/11:44)</a><br>
When cornering limits are exceeded, G29 wheel seems to go into 'slow motion',<br> making spins unrecoverable.<br>
Assetto Corsa physics software overwhelming Gateway i5 was originally suspected,<br>
but it still happened with Alienware Aurora i7, so perhaps G29 was overwhelmed by too much I/O.<br>
Perhaps diverting appropriate feedback from G29 to other haptics would help,<br>
leaving only those that actually help steer..<br>
<br>

Many sim racers use sim racing chassis, with actuators at 4 corners;<br>
<a href="https://www.slip-angle.com/new-page-1">Slip-Angle</a> has IMO a good isolation system for extruded aluminum chassis.<br>
Sim Racing Studio's
<a href="https://www.simracingstudio.com/product-page/srs-shakekit-shakeseat-integrated-with-shakebox-lite">ShakeKit</a> was
comprised of <a href="https://www.simracingstudio.com/product-page/srs-license">software</a>, USB soundcard, amplifiers,<br>
and 4 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0045W10VW">Dayton bass shaker pucks</a> in a thinly padded seat cushion.<br>
That <a href="https://www.simracingstudio.com/product-page/srs-shakeseat">ShakeSeat cushion</a> was available separately for about half the cost.<br>
<a href="http://simracinggarage.com/sim-racing-studio-shakekit-review">Barry Rowland</a> considers the ShakeKit: &nbsp
"Probably the easiest way for you to get<br> a proper feeling transducer solution deployed on your Sim Racing setup."<br>

Debugged the above and wired a matching bulkhead connector via 6 ft zip cord<br>
to mismatched  amplifiers, one with an FM tuner,<br>
so fed an FM station to the rear ShakeSeat puck pair.<br>
Sound is surprisingly intelligible and the feel is at least not unpleasant.<br>
Left and right are easily distinguished,<br>
but blend nicely when fed equal amounts of monaural signal,<br>
so left rear vs right rear vs both rear should be useful cues.<br>

<a name=pad><h4>[dis]comfort</h4></a>
As a frequent bike rider, my butt is not particularly tender,<br>
but sitting on four hard pucks for hours is unpleasant,<br>
and Sim Racing Studio's soft foam does little to spread pressure.<br>
From available 1/2" INTERLOCKING EVA FOAM MATS:

<br>
one was trimmed one to about 17x17 inches and marked using a bowl<br> for disc removal at puck locations:<br>

After a hundred or so hours of moderately intense sitting,<br>
the EVA foam-supplemented ShakeSeat looks like this:<br>
