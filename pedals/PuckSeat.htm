<h3>PuckSeat:&nbsp DIY ShakeSeat</h3>
SRS no longer offers the original <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SVC7VV2">ShakeKit</a>, which was essentially:<ul>
<li>a 4-channel soundcard and amplifier
<li>four <a href="https://www.daytonaudio.com/product/1104/tt25-8-puck-tactile-transducer-mini-bass-shaker">Dayton TT25-8 pucks</a> and wiring<br><img src=image/pucks.jpg>
<li>a roughly 45cm (18") square cloth zippered seat cushion with skimpy foam padding
</ul><br>
While the following images are from refurbishing <a href="./#SRS">my ShakeIt cushion</a>, DIY from scratch would be similar.<br>
Issues with first generation ShakeIt cushion modifications:<ul>
<li>Pucks are nearly twice as thick as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001M8MWI2">EVA foam mat</a>
<li>Mat holes did not prevent pucks from wandering</ul><br>

<b>4 years later and wiser</b>:<ol>
<li>Suitable zippered cloth seat cushion covers are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PW88RD1">readily available</a>:<br>
<img width=600 src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61gwLnS4ejL._AC_SL1500_.jpg"><br><br>
<li>Instead of sound card and amplifier, if your PC motherboard has an unused HDMI connector,<br>
consider scrounging a cheap surround receiver with HDMI input (yard sale, thrift shop, ebay),<br>
any of which should be capable of driving 15 Watts per channel to Dayton pucks.<br>
A more powerful pre-HDMI 7.1 receiver, here driven from motherboard audio,<br> enables other channels to drive larger transducers.
<li>Original skimpy SRS padding is nearly dead after 4 years,<br> which will not matter because it no longer needs to provide much padding.<br>
Roll of black drawer cushion (upper right) was not needed.<br>

<li>Second EVA pad was trimmed slightly smaller than first,<br>with added thickness taking up slack in cloth cover.<br>
Wooden disk will be centered in original EVA pad holes to locate smaller puck faces:<br>

<li>serrated steak knife in action:<br><img src=image/stabbed.jpg>
<li>Pucks were hot-glued to EVA mat from the other side,<br> then secured using duct tape on this side.<br>
Note vent holes, which should NOT be blocked by tape.<br><img src=image/fit.jpg>
<li>Larger chunk of original SRS foam was not reused;<br>
4 smaller chunks were hot-glued over larger puck surfaces, which will face up:<br>
<img src=image/tuck.jpg>
<li>ready for reinstallation!<br><img src=image/renewed.jpg>
<li>I did not keep track of original puck assignments (fore/aft, left/right);<br>
reassignment by SimHub channel testing, then reconnecting at amplifier binding posts.
