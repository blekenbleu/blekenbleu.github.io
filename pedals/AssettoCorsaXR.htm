<dd>Was good for WMR; but left shimmering rails and fences
<dt><br>100% resolution, very high graphic settings and post processing filters<br>
 &emsp; and all the Custom Shaders Patch goodies
<dd>constant 90 fps with the largest FOV. I don't like driving at night or with rain,
<br> so I don't have to care too much about frame drops
<dt><br>There's a web browser app in the <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV3z12q1HSc>App Shelf</a>
<dt><br>When moving my head, textures come and disappear
<dd>Switched off single pass stereo on CM - that worked<br>

<dt><br>Does anyone have an idea of how to uncap my fps in vr in content manager
<dd>I've just discovered a few mins ago that if i switch off post filters ie sol<br>
 then i get a flat 90 fps with about 60% headroom,<br>
 altho I haven't tried it yet I think the version of sol im using is old,<br>
 because it also makes the screen appear dark until i manually reset it in game,<br>
 I'll try installing a new sol<br>
 which should allow me to utilize all that extra headroom for eye candy..<br>
 I'd tried a newer version of content manager and nothing had changed<br>
 without realizing it may be the sol im using which I hadn't updated separately,<br>
 hope this helps anyone else who may have a similar issue

<dt><br>Best mods for VR
<dd>converted track from old games like GTL, RFc1 are in 90% of the case, crap.<br>
 Full of low poly and 2D stuff . Same is counting for old tracks made before 2020,<br>
 as here the quality is mostly below Kunos own.<br>
For a starter I would try @Fat-Alfie @LilSki tracks

<dt><br>Trying to fix the aliasing in vr. 
<dd>Aliasing is particularly bad at midday on arnco,<br>
 so adjust the time for less glaring issues there.<br>
I use a combination of supersampling and fholger's <a href=https://github.com/fholger/vrperfkit>vrperfkit</a>.<br>
 The contrast adaptive sharpening there seems to work well if used in moderation.<br>
For vrperfkit i use these settings:<br>
<pre>
upscaling:

enabled: true
method: cas
renderScale: 0.95
sharpness: 0.55
radius: 0.6
applyMipBias: true


fixedFoveated:

enabled: true
innerRadius: 0.6
midRadius: 0.8
outerRadius: 1.0
favorHorizontal: true
</pre>
 5% downres (renderscale setting) then sharpening helps combat jaggies fairly effectively<br>
 when combined with device supersampling (e.g. Index at 200%).<br><br>

 Fixed foveated section allows clawing back some performance, enabling higher supersampling.<br>
 You may notice some artifacts at the edge of your vision such as on certain tracks<br>
 things like trees won't be rendered at all in that outer edge. Its not a common thing to see though.<br><br>

Disable Anisotropic Filtering in Content Manager<br>
 and enable it (x16) in your nVidia driver panel<br>
 in the game specific 3D settings section for Assetto Corsa.<br><br>

If you have already tried my settings for vrperfkit and still want it sharper,<br>
 you could raise the sharpening value there.<br>
 You could try not using the 0.95 render scale<br>
 and just using 1.0 but you're going to introduce shimmer.<br><br>

You could also experiment with changing the LOD bias to a negative value.<br>
 Set that in Content Manager "Settings>Assetto Corsa>Video>System:"<br>
 Bear in mind this can cause more shimmering.<br><br>

One thing you didn't mention as an issue but I think you'll probably end up noticing<br>
 is the car LOD transition happens a little too soon when in VR - its more noticable.<br>
 I like to bump up the car LOD distance slider to 125%.<br>
 This will have an effect on performance if you like to race with large grids though so beware.<br>
 Under Settings>Custom Shader Patch>Graphic Adjustments>LOD Settings>Multiplier for car LOD

<dt><br>VR How to stop looking though seat head support
<dd>You'd want to adjust the clip planes<br>
 Custom Shaders Patch -> Graphics Adjustments -> 'Adaptive clip planes'<br>
Turned it off and now all is well. Still wondering what performance impact that setting has though..<br>

<dd>Nvidia Control Panel settings all standard except:<pre>
FXAA : ON
Low Latency : ON or ULTRA
Shader Cache size : as large as you can</pre>

<dt><br>tyres screeching
<dd>In Content Manager, go to Settings > Assetto Corsa > Audio, and adjust the "Tyre Offset" setting.<br>
 If set to 200%, you will hear the tyres screeching when you actually lose traction.<br>
 Setting it any lower will activate the tyre screeching sound before your tyres are actually sliding.<br>
 The default value is provides a misleading audio cue.<br>
 You'll have to relearn to drive for awhile afterwards, as you adjust to the change.
<dt><br>issues with picture quality
<dd>I do hate the typical AC shimmers/jaggies lots more and want to keep the FPS at certain level.<br>
 Achieve by compromise; reducing shadows/reflections and rain.<br>
 CM settings red "!" helps keep things low and see what effect they bring.<br>
 Smart shadows great, but if not being notable as a realistic shadow by shimmers/jaggies.<br>
I never noticed any real improvements in 3D depth by an PPfilter,<br>
 but if missing a detailed view at a certain distance,<br>
 may I suggest; set anisotropic filter to 0 in CM and to 16x in nVidia CP ACspecific.<br>

<dt><br>mirrors black in one eye, ok in other
<dd>Try turning off 'high quality mirrors' (I think) in AC video settings
<dt><br>headlights impact fps
<dd>Go to LightingFX and set "Cars casting lights" to 0 cars
