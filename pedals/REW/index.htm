<h4>Intro</h4>
<details>
<summary>REW is not for <i>only</i> rooms <code>[click for details]</code></summary>
<a href="https://www.roomeqwizard.com/">REW</a> is mostly used to help locate and tune subwoofers,<br>
mostly by measuring and displaying audio responses.<br>
Frequency response peaks can be mitigated by equalizing,<br>
but sharp dips typically result from cancellations AKA destructive interference,<br>
which are better addressed by relocating a single subwoofer<br>
or changing phase relations among multiple subwoofers, also possibly by relocation.<br>

The same techniques will apply for tactile transducers,<br>
keeping in mind that sound travels faster thru solids than air,<br>
so that substantial changes in phase relationships are more easily done electronically.

<a name=REW><h4>Room EQ Wizard frequency response measurements</h4>
A first step is to evaluate limitations of equipment:<ul compact>
<li>sound card[s]
<li>amplifier
<li>transducers and sensors
</ul>
Here is frequency and phase response of Realtek motherboard audio output<br>
looped back to PreSonus AUDIOBOX USB line input:<br>
<img src="soundcard.png"><br clear=all><br>

Anomalies @ 1kHz are presumably PreSonus cross-talk artifacts<br>
 from REW reference tone in the other channel;<br>
2k, 3k and 4k glitches may be harmonics of the same.<br>
How much of rolloff below 60Hz is attributable to motherboard audio or PreSonus is unknown,<br>
but one takeaway for those using massive Bass Shakers is that soundcards may be a weak link.<br>
<br>
With haptics of interest to me ranging only from 10 to 800Hz, loop-back calibrating yields:<br>
<img src="cal_soundcard.png"><br>
Flatter is nicer, but 1dB is trivial after introducing amplifier, transducer and sensor:<br>
<img src="thrusterHeld.png"><br>
Without mass loading, useful piezo low frequency response is not expected.<br>
<br>
The Dayton "thruster" transducer audibly rattles at some frequencies<br>
 if not hand-held against the (30mm MDF) desktop:<br>
<img src="unheld.png"><br>
<br>

Sensors being used are piezo contact microphone elements epoxied "belly-to-belly",<br>
with brass discs facing out, shielding both sides.  Piezos are wired in parallel,<br>
effectively lowering source impedance, which is still high enough that,<br>
fed into a 500kOhm input impedance instrument input,<br>
cable shielding is very important to avoid AC power hum inductive pickup.<br>
Wireless mouse RF noise and LCD screen refresh interference may still be audible..<br>
<br>
Thruster movement is sensed at 12Hz but weak until 15Hz,<br> then noticeably stronger above 22Hz.<br>
Mechanical resonance of the thruster NOT held to 30mm MDF is around 40-45Hz<br>
Finger-holding a 13mm steel nut against the piezo approximates mass-loading<br>
and yields more credible plots:<br>
<img src="FingerNut.png"><br>
.. but results are inconsistent.<br>
The (consistent) resonance around 15Hz, corresponding to large phase changes,<br>
 is presumably the 30mm MDF, since it corresponds with cancellations.<br>
  Sweeps while holding the thruster against difference surfaces<br>
result in resonances at different frequencies.  This suggests that<br>
uncalibrated piezos probably lack ideally uniform frequency response<br>
but should be able to help analyze differences<br>
in transducer responses in different configurations.<br>
