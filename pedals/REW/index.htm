<h4>Intro</h4>
<details>
<summary>REW is not for <i>only</i> rooms <code>[click for details]</code></summary>
<a href="https://www.roomeqwizard.com/">REW</a> is mostly used to help locate and tune subwoofers,<br>
mostly by measuring and displaying audio responses.<br>
Frequency response peaks can be mitigated by equalizing,<br>
but sharp dips typically result from cancellations AKA destructive interference,<br>
which are better addressed by relocating a single subwoofer<br>
or changing phase relations among multiple subwoofers, also possibly by relocation.<br>

The same techniques will apply for tactile transducers,<br>
keeping in mind that sound travels faster thru solids than air,<br>
so that substantial changes in phase relationships are more easily done electronically.

<a name=REW><h4>Room EQ Wizard frequency response measurements</h4>
A first step is to evaluate limitations of equipment:<ul compact>
<li>sound card[s]
<li>amplifier
<li>transducers and sensors
</ul>
Here is frequency and phase response of Realtek motherboard audio output<br>
looped back to PreSonus AUDIOBOX USB line input:<br>

How much of rolloff below 60Hz is attributable to motherboard audio or PreSonus is unknown,<br>
but one takeaway for those using massive Bass Shakers is that soundcards may be a weak link.<br>
<br>
With haptics of interest to me ranging only from 10 to 800Hz, loop-back calibrating yields:<br>

While flatter would be nicer, 1dB will seem trivial after amplifier, transducer and sensor are introduced.
