A pioneer in converting sim telemetry to bass shaker audio,<br>
that is now also available from (free) <a href=ShakeItBassShakers.htm>SimHub</a> as well as SRS' ShakeKit.<br>
SimXperience has since integrated SimVibe with
<a href="https://www.simxperience.com/en-us/products/software/simcommander4.aspx">Sim Commander 4</a>,<br>
which also drives their <a href="#DD">AccuForce direct drive steering wheel</a> (<i>acquired</i>).<br>
<br>
SimXperience warns that multiple identical sound adapters can be problematic.<br>
Both Aurora motherboard and Samsung Odyssey+ sound identify as Realtek:<br>
Intel and NVIDIA audio are presumably about HDMI. &nbsp Despite nomenclature,<br>
Windows 10 Sound Blaster X-Fi support appears to be only stereo.<br>
Realtek motherboard audio is enabled only after plugging into 1/8 phone jacks.<br>
Realtek USB2.0 device disappears when Odyssey+ HMD sleeps,<br>
reportedly confusing SimVibe/Sim Commander 4 (SC4),<br>
which evidently keys off sequence in list of available devices.<br>
Since Assetto Corsa already loses access to G29 and TH8A<br>
unless launched <b>after</b> Steam and Content Manager,<br>
inserting SC4 launch may also be problematic.<br>

<br>
"You have to select the audio-source in SC4 while the Odyssey is running."<br>
Then launch SC4 after SteamVR and activate the profile last,<br>&emsp; so don't launch games with SC4.<br>
I would prefer a fix, but once you got used to it, it's not a game-breaker,<br>
because in window-mode you can launch SC4 while the game is loading.<br>
If the headset falls to sleep mode, the output in SC4 is dead<br> &emsp; and
<a href="https://simxperience.com/Default.aspx?tabid=742&g=posts&m=24721#post24721">
you need to re-launch it the next time</a>.<br>
<br>

IMO, hard to use,
if "use" means anything other than launching a default<br>
or something useful [but painfully] configured and debugged..<br>
Documentation and software have both evolved since I tried it.
<br>
At least on my Windows 10 64-bit Home PC,<br>
pop-up windows essential to Sim Commander 4 installation were hidden beneath<br>
the main setup window, resulting in no progress until raised from the taskbar.<br>
<br>
Sim Commander license code displayed online was truncated;<br>
fortunately, gif was fully visible after download (to USB1TB/Sim).<br>
After initial setup, Sim Commander splash window plays obnoxious drum solo,<br>
which can be stifled by clearing Background Music in Control Center.<br>
<br>
Rerunning Auto Search found Assetto Corsa, but not games in <code>E:\my\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common</code><br>
.. which were added manually, but still do not show up on SC4 splash screen.<br>
<br>
Configuring SC4 launch by Content Manager was doomed;<br>
no Output Mixer and seemingly no ShakeSeat output.<br>
<br>
This was cured by adding a fresh Sim Commander profile<br>
(using big + at bottom of main screen) and selecting Assetto Corsa,<br>
then duplicating and changing game to Content Manager.<br>
After that, even the original Content Manager profile has an Output Mixer...<br>
<br>

<br>
SimVibe chassis appears to support neither traction loss nor ABS,<br>
but has estimated wheel lockup (mono), oversteer and "custom simvibe effect"<br>
<br>
Good news: switching from single screen to openvr in Content Manager<br>
launched from SC4 did not lose SimVib, but did lose remapped mouse buttons<br>
until logging out and back in, then launching CM from steam,<br>
THEN launching (really, just attaching) CM/AC from SC4,<br>
at which point SimVib and mouse buttons both worked.<br>
<br>
Somehow overnight, SC4 lost all profiles except Forza 7 and AC from scratch..?<br>
<br>
SC4 still launches a useless black abomination that is presumably its so-called Dashboard<br>
<br>
After fiddling with Sim Commander 4 SimVibe<ul>
<li> it is more about simulating road feel than haptics feedback to help drive
<li> documentation sucked and effect names were unhelpful<ul>

SimHub <a href="ShakeItBassShakers.htm">ShakeIt Bass Shakers</a> is a better choice for me..
