## (Canon) cameras
My favorite SLR was the Minolta SRT-101, because controls were as expected.  
Super Takumar lenses were better, but Pentax usability was not there for me.

We got a Canon 20D because that was the first affordable DSLR with 8mp,  
which I considered the minimum acceptable, and a good range of lenses.  
Fully intending to eventually get some generation of 5D, that 20D served  
until wanting to "solve" birds-in-flight justified a 7D mk II.  
A 6D taught that low light and wide angle were uncompelling (to me).  
APS-C turns out to be a sweet spot for photomicography;  
90D and M6 II resolution and focus bracketing are nearly ideal.  

### Canon acronyms
- EOS = ElectoOptical System  
- EF = Electro-Focus (although some EF lenses are manual focus)  
- EF-S = Electro-Focus Small (APS-C)  
- EF-M = Electro-Focus Mirrorless (but only APS-C)  
- EOS R = Electro-Optical System Re-Imagined  
- RF = Re-Imagined Focus  
Thankfully, EF, EF-S, EF-M and RF all share the same lens control signalling,  
so mounts differ only in diameters and sensor spacings.
