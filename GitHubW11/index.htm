<h2>GitHub Desktop and Jekyll on Windows 11</h2>
Differences in Jekyll experiences on different Windows versions is mostly about Ruby and Jekyll evolution.<br>
Ruby installation has become more trouble-free, without hangs and need for retries.<br>
Jekyll, on the other hand, seems IMO to have regressed:<br>
<li>&lt;details&gt; seemingly are no longer supported in markdown
<li>markdown defaults to blog-specific format
<li>ignores markdown files lacking front matter starting on the first line<br><br>

This last issue is a distinct difference between Windows Jekyll and whatever GitHub uses to process markdown.<br>
Fortunately, empty front matter suffices, and a ### heading immediately following overrides the default title.<br>
My pages include over 60 markdown files that needed editting for this issue;
<li>starting over, I would completely avoid markdown for GitHub Pages;
<li>trivial changes typically require over 5 minutes for GitHub to process.<br>

<h3>Ruby updates</h3>
Gems can be updated, but Ruby itself as installed by <a href="https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/">RubyInstaller</a> cannot be updated, only replaced.<br>
While Ruby is here used <i>only</i> for Jekyll, its bundled MSYS2 installation gets used a lot, with numerous packages added.<br>
Before replacing Ruby, run MSYS2 package manager to document its current package list:<br>
<li>`pacman -Q > /d/oldMSYS2.txt`<br>
.. then compare with a list from new MSYS2 to determine what packages had been added.<br>
Of course, any MSYS2 home/user folder customizations should also be ported.<br>
