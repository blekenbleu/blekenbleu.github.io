<dd><b>NY Times: new confirmed cases and deaths for localities</b><br>
I now find cumulative or growth rate plots harder to appreciate than new cases;<br>
scrolling to the bottom of this URL gives access to plots by state:<br>

<br>
About half-way down that same page are new cases for some metro areas,<br>
not including e.g. Savannah GA (about 30 minutes from our home).<br>
FWIW, Syracuse NY looks hopeful., particularly compared to e.g.<br>
 Buffalo, Atlanta GA or Columbia SC.<br>

&gt; On the weird side, St Joe's hospital in Syracuse layed off workers<br>
&gt; because no one is having elective surgery and there is not enough hospitaliztions of Corona to keep them busy...<br>
&gt; Rochester is eeriely quiet (not sure if it is Strong or U of R)..<br>
<br>
KY Hospitals similarly laid off many employees unrelated to COVID-19 care.<br>
<br>
SC case growth is not expected to peak before the end of April<br>
<br>
&gt; Cayuga County NY has had 561 tested, 537 results, 31 positive for 6%<br>

Wow, testing here is about 50% positive.<br>

&gt; I listen to Gov Cuomo every day,<br>
&gt; and he has said for a few weeks that the death numbers will peak a week to 10 days after the peak of the hospitalizations.<br>
<br>
I have not found data for hospitalizations vs positive cases reported;<br>
my current best guess for NY is 13 day average delay from reported to deaths.<br>
3.5 weeks ago, it appears to have been around 7 days delay,<br>
then 10 days from 2 to 3 weeks ago<br>
and 12 days delay 1 week ago.<br>
Today, Cuomo reported that hospitalizations are down.<br>
I only access data for the state, which continues reporting relatively<br>
constant 10K new cases per day,<br>
so hospitalizations may be down in NYC metro area but up elsewhere...?<br>
<dt>Apr 10, 2020
<dd><b>NY stats</b><br>
I may be wrong, but deaths appear to lag new cases by 10-15 days.<br>

Compared with yesterday's graph, this one plots growth over 4 instead of 9 days.<br>
Still using Mar 22 data for presumed recoveries, so perhaps overstating growth.<br>

NY having increased only 10% over 4 days may seem encouraging,<br>
but would still result in doubling over a month.<br>
I wonder whether CT will be in the news before its hospitals overflow?<br>
<br>
There seem to be far too many yahoos who suppose physical distancing<br>
can reasonably be relaxed before folks are vaccinated.<br>

To visualize whether/when cresting occurs in selected states,<br>
my first chart plots growth in positive tests between April 5 and 7.<br>

AZ is behaving, CT is doomed and GA will pay for their governor's foolishness.<br><br>
Since any sick folks that we personally know are not included,<br>
a second chart plots percent testing growth vs percent of population,<br>
keeping in mind that many tests are duplicates for critical workers.<br>

COVID data from states with tests < 1% of population are IMO suspect.<br>
NC is flying blind.  CA  is waiting for results from nearly half its tests.<br>
Only 4 states report positive COVID for more than 1/1000: NY, NJ, MI, WA.<br>
Other states may have less COVID or insufficient testing.<br>
MI is interesting; after bad-mouthing its governor,<br>
someone presumably pointed out to Trump that he would need their votes.  <br>
<br>
Since <a href="https://covidtracking.com">https://covidtracking.com</a> reports cumulative totals,<br>
a third plot subtracts Mar 22 totals from April 7 totals,<br>
(supposing most reported cases remain active for about another 2 weeks)<br>
and compares that difference to Mar 29 total.  Except for WA, that reduces totals by < 10%.<br>

While not all active cases are hospitalized,<br>
scaling to better approximate states' healthcare stress now uses<br>
available beds (from <a href="https://covid19.healthdata.org">https://covid19.healthdata.org</a>) rather than population.<br>
CT and NJ should soon be getting as much attention as NJ.<br>
For the 4 states with most active cases per hospital bed,<br>
their rates of reported case increases over the last week<br>
are negatively correlated to their active case loads,<br>
which could mean that distancing is beginning to work for them<br>
or they are too stressed to fully report.<br>

It is encouraging that 2 highest increased residence rates have lowest CIVID growth rates.<br>
Missouri is worrying, but perhaps reflects better test reporting now than earlier.<br>
This also does not capture how risky is typical behavior away from home...

I should have also tabulated states' percent of population tested,<br>

As time goes on, many of the same critical workers may be retested,<br>

South Carolina received a federal disaster declaration for COVID-19 on Mar 28.
With a population of over 5.2 million, South Carolina reports testing 3,675 or 0.07%,
with 18% positive and most negative tests presumably among health workers.
Given general population testing effectively limited to those with serious symptoms,
this may be a good population for estimating how serious are symptoms among
and between age groups.  For example, the percentage of positive tests
among those 40-50 is roughly the same as their percentage of SC population.
Folks 60-70 appear 73% more likely than them to have severe symptoms
while children 10-20 are only 30% as likely. <pre>
