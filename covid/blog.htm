One issue with <b><i>using excess mortality to manage epidemics</i></b>:<br>

that rate is <i>lower</i> than for their previous 3 days (orange)<br>
while Colleton experienced <i>an increased</i> case rate.<br>
Places like NYC now approach 3% gray, and random testing suggests that<br>
many places have about 6 times as many folks with antibodies as confirmed cases,<br>
so New York may be approaching 20% "herd immunity".<br>
<a href="#MODEL">My simple computer simulation</a> suggests that<br>

<dd><b>SARS-CoV-2 herd immunity at a population-wide infection rate of ~40%</b><br>
.. by introducing age and activity heterogeneities into population models<br>
A mathematical model with proportion of infected individuals in groups<br>
with high contact rates greater than that in groups with low contact rates.<br>
One of the simplest of all epidemic models is to assume<br>
a homogeneously mixing population<br>
in which all individuals are equally susceptible<br>
and equally infectious if they become infected.<br>
Two important features known to play an important role in disease spreading were added:<br>
1) divide the herd into 6 age groups and fit contact rates derived from an empirical study<br>
2) categorize individuals into three different activity levels,<br>
&nbsp which are arbitrary and chosen for illustration purposes:<br>
&nbsp 50% of each age cohort have normal activity,<br>
&nbsp 25% have half as many contacts compared with normal activity, and<br>
&nbsp 25% have twice as many contacts as normal activity.<br>
Individuals who get infected are assumed to be initially latent for a mean of 3 days,<br>
followed by an infectious period of a mean of 4 days.  After a month,<br>
 preventive measures are implemented such that<br>
 all averages in the next-generation matrix are scaled by the same factor a < 1.<br>
These preventive measures are kept until the ongoing epidemic is nearly finished.<br>
That is, all preventive measures are relaxed thus setting a back to 1 after 3.5 months<br>
If herd immunity is not reached, then there will then be a second wave,<br>
whereas if herd immunity has been achieved, the epidemic continues to decline.<br>

Estimation of incubation period distribution of COVID-19 using disease onset forward time:<br>
A novel cross-sectional and forward follow-up study based on<br>
1084 cases of patients who contracted COVID-19 in Wuhan, then left.<br>
The estimated median incubation period was 7.76 days<br>
[95% confidence interval (CI): 7.02 to 8.53],<br>
and the 90th percentile was 14.28 days (95% CI: 13.64 to 14.90).<br>

A group of six biopharmaceutical firms researching monoclonal antibody (mAb) candidates<br>
recently sought [and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) granted] permission<br>
under antitrust law to exchange "technical information" on each other's manufacturing processes and platforms<br>
(but not information on cost or price).<br>

Mass cytometry was used to assess immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in<br>
52 COVID-19 patients that were confirmed positive for viral RNA by PCR and<br>
62 age and gender-matched healthy controls distributed between two independent cohorts,<br>
1) the Princess Margaret Hospital at Hong Kong University,<br>
2) the Hope Clinic at Emory University in Atlanta, USA<br>
There was a striking increase in the frequency of plasmablast and effector CD8 T cells<br>
in all infected individuals in both cohorts. Of note, the kinetics of the CD8 effector T cell response<br>
was prolonged and continued to increase up to day 40 post onset of symptoms.<br>
These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a spatial dichotomy<br>
in the innate immune response, characterized by suppression of peripheral innate immunity,<br>
in the face of proinflammatory responses reported in the lung.<br>

Between 2009 and 2019, U.S. flu vaccine effectiveness ranged from 19% to 60%.<br>
Immunity from a shot in early Fall can dissipate before winter's end.<br>
B cells reside in bone marrow and make antibodies that can attach to and disable viruses,<br>
taking several days after an infection to produce high levels of antibodies<br>
- a disadvantage in influenza, which can cause disease rapidly.  Adjuvants boost vaccine<br>
effectiveness by acting as irritants, ramping up the immune response.<br>
Developed in the 1940s, the first influenza vaccines used adjuvants,<br>
but caused ulcers at injection sites and were dropped from later vaccines.<br>
A revamped influenza vaccine that has an oil-in-water adjuvant<br>
- the water shields the oil and makes it safer - has been used in Italy since 1997<br>
and was approved by European and U.S. regulators in 2000 and 2015, respectively.<br>

In a July 31 letter, the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee<br>
described hospitals as "scrambling" to determine how to meet new daily Covid-19<br>
reporting requirements to the US Department of Health and Human Services,<br>

"Moving forward, it will be even more challenging to perform meaningful inter-state<br>
 comparisons, and to understand which COVID-19 mitigation strategies were successful<br>
 (or failed)."<br>

Thursday, Matthew McConaughey interviewed Dr. Anthony Fauci for 40 minutes on Instagram.<br>
What about letting everyone get infected so we all become immune and the disease dies out?<br>
"If everyone contracted it ... a lot of people are going to die," Fauci said.<br>
"The death toll would be enormous and totally unacceptable," Fauci added.<br>
"And that's the reason why we're against saying,<br>
 'Let it fly. Let everybody get infected and we'll be fine.' That's a bad idea."<br>

experts are sceptical</a><br>
In 2009, the small biotech company in PA rushed to develop an H1N1 vaccine.<br>
After announcing promising early results, Inovio's stock soared more than 1,000%.<br>
Riding the momentum, the company sold more shares to the public.&nbsp Since then,<br>
Inovio has announced encouraging news about its work on vaccines for malaria,<br>
the Zika virus and even a cancer vaccine. Upbeat declarations have caused<br>
the company's stock price to leap, enriching investors and senior executives.<br>
There's only one catch: Inovio has never actually brought a vaccine to market.<br>
While there are some early signs of promise with its COVID-19 vaccine,<br>
Inovio has released only bare-bones data from the first phase of clinical trials. It is locked in<br>
a legal battle with a key manufacturing partner which claims that Inovio stole its technology.<br>
While it claims to be part of Operation Warp Speed, Inovio is not on the list of companies<br>
selected to receive financial support to mass-produce vaccines.<br>

Putting the Public Back in Public Health - Surveying Symptoms of Covid-19<br>
To date, most projections of the Covid-19 burden have been based on<br>
incidence calculated from Covid-19 testing, hospitalizations, and deaths.<br>
However, such estimates are severely limited.<br>
New and cost-efficient participatory syndromic-surveillance tools have been developed<br>
that can be used in real time to rapidly address critical near-term needs.<br>
These tools work by capturing data on reported symptoms using mobile technology<br>
such as phone apps or Internet-based questionnaires, which often provide<br>
more timely signals of infectious disease transmission than more traditional sources.<br>

<dd><b>Companies test COVID-19 antibody drugs</b><br>
It can take a month or two after vaccination or infection<br>
for the most effective antibodies to form naturally.<br>
Companies are rushing to test drugs that deliver antibodies to fight the virus right away,<br>
without having to train the immune system to make them.<br>
"If we can generate them in large concentrations, in big vats in an antibody factory<br>
... we can kind of bypass the immune system."<br>
These drugs are believed to last for a month or more<br>
and could give quick, temporary immunity to people at high risk of infection,<br>
such as health workers and housemates of someone with COVID-19.<br>
Eli Lilly has already started manufacturing its antibody drug,<br>
betting that studies now underway will give positive results.<br>

Public release of hospital data about the coronavirus pandemic has slowed to a crawl,<br>

Key indicators, such as estimates of the portion of inpatient beds occupied by Covid-19 patients,<br>

By analyzing the immune response in 76 people with COVID-19 and in 69 healthy people,<br>
investigators at the Stanford University of Medicine and other institutions<br>
found enhanced levels of molecules that promote inflammation in the blood of severely ill COVID-19 patients.<br>
Three of the molecules identified have been shown to be associated with lung inflammation<br>
in other diseases but had not been shown previously in COVID-19 infections.<br>
Key cells of the innate immune system in the blood of COVID-19 patients<br>

Using nanometer-level simulations, Northwestern University researchers discovered<br>
a positively charged site (known as the polybasic cleavage site) located 10 nanometers from<br>
the actual binding site on the spike protein. The positively charged site allows strong bonding<br>
between the virus protein and the negatively charged human-cell receptors.<br>
A negatively charged molecule was designed that binds to cleavage sites,<br>
blocking and inhibiting virus bonding to host cells.  "We didn't expect to see<br>
 electrostatic interactions at 10 nanometers. In physiological conditions,<br>
 all electrostatic interactions no longer occur at distances longer than 1 nanometer."<br>

<dd><b>COVID-19: Immune system gone astray</b><br>
Contrary to what has been generally assumed so far,<br>
a <i>severe</i> course of COVID-19 does not solely result in a strong immune reaction<br>
- rather, the immune response is caught in a continuous loop of activation and inhibition.<br>
"Here, neutrophils and monocytes are only partially activated and they do not function properly.<br>
&nbsp We find considerably more immature cells that have a rather inhibitory effect on the immune<br>
&nbsp response. The phenomenon can also be observed in other severe infections,<br>
&nbsp although the reason for this is unclear. Many indications suggest that the immune system<br>
&nbsp stands in its own way during severe courses of COVID-19. This could possibly lead to<br>
&nbsp an insufficient immune response against the corona virus,<br>
&nbsp with a simultaneous severe inflammation in the lung tissue."<br>

Credible assumptions replace missing data in COVID analysis<br>
Using a technique called "partial identification," researchers concluded that<br>
actual cumulative rates of COVID-19 infection are higher than reported rates of infection,<br>
and therefore actual infection fatality rates are lower than reported rates.<br>
They assumed that<br>
infection rate among those tested is higher than the rate among those who are not,<br>
and some persons tested were actually positive but not counted (false negatives).<br>
"The bounds you get are wide, but they are substantially tighter<br>
&nbsp compared to the bounds you obtain if you assume nothing about the missing data."<br>

A new open-source coronavirus simulation,<br>
released to help authorities forecast the effects of local lockdown measures,<br>
has predicted that a second wave of COVID 19 is probable in 'almost all cases'<br>
across the London Boroughs for which it has been run,<br>
although the outbreak is likely to be significantly less severe than the first.<br>
"Our simulations allow authorities to see the impact of things like closing a local supermarket,<br>
&nbsp or changing the constraints placed on schools or businesses at a very local level."<br>
The simulation was validated up to 80 days using anonymised data<br>
supplied by the London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust<br>
and contains a "very wide range of local intervention types"<br>
- from shutting pubs or limiting access to parks,<br>
&nbsp to closing certain businesses or restricting individual households -<br>
to help local authorities plan lock-down measures.<br>
"We hope that others can take the codes and model their local areas<br>
- so councils could do that or even local volunteers,<br>
&nbsp to get an idea of how COVID-19 is spreading in their local community.<br>

Tiny Texas company eTrueNorth runs most of the drive-thru Covid-19 testing in the U.S.<br>
The company has brought in more than $90 million in federal contracts<br>
to help oversee more than 350 sites and pay for the tests.<br>
For eTrueNorth to sign a contract with the Department of Health and Human Services,<br>
it needed to find CLIA-certified labs that would run whatever tests they collected.<br>
Eventually, it found three: HealthQuest Esoterics in California,<br>
Gravity Diagnostics in Kentucky, and Reditus Laboratories near Peoria, Ill.<br>
However, the federal government's community-based testing sites account for<br>
a remarkably small proportion of the country's daily count.<br>

University of Michigan medicinal chemists have used artificial intelligence<br>
to find alternative pharmaceutical building blocks for 12 drugs under investigation to treat COVID-19.<br>
Those drugs include bromhexine, camostat, cobicistat, darunavir, favipiravir, galidesivir, nelfinavir,<br>
ritonavir, umifenovir, ribavirin, remdesivir and baricitinib.<br>
"The route we have found for some of these potential therapeutics might be longer than what's out there,<br>

and starting materials that are cheaper than what's currently available.<br>

With the Trump administration aiming to deliver 300 million doses of vaccine<br>
against the coronavirus as early as January, state officials and health experts say<br>
they remain in the dark about key details and, therefore, are inadequately prepared<br>
for what is expected to be the largest single vaccination campaign ever undertaken.<br>

"It's probably the hardest thing they're going to do,"</a> Paul A. Offit,<br>

and a member of a federal vaccine advisory group.<br>
At a recent briefing for the advisory group by Operation Warp Speed,<br>
the administration's effort to fast-track development of coronavirus countermeasures,<br>
Lt. Gen. Paul Ostrowski, who oversees logistics, said<br>
 the military would move vaccines onto trucks for distribution "the day after"<br>
 the drugs received regulatory approval from the FDA, Offit recalled.<br>
But Offit said that, based on the administration's inability to<br>
 develop a national testing strategy,<br>
 secure adequate supplies of personal protective equipment, and<br>
 deliver a consistent message about wearing face masks,<br>
the question he wanted to ask Ostrowski but didn't have the chance was basic:<br>
"Given that the administration efforts have largely been failures,<br>
 what makes you think this will work?"<br>
The administration already botched a rollout of remdesivir,<br>

Potential COVID-19antiviral drug development<br>
This review highlights recent research in the structure, function and development<br>
of antiviral drugs targeting the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 [a],<br>
which plays a key role in the receptor recognition and cell membrane fusion process,<br>
and is composed of two subunits, S1 and S2 [b-c].<br>
<img width=640 src="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41401-020-0485-4/MediaObjects/41401_2020_485_Fig2_HTML.png"><br clear=all>
<br>
The S1 subunit contains a receptor-binding domain<br>
that recognizes and binds to the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [d],<br>
while the S2 subunit mediates viral cell membrane fusion<br>
by forming a six-helical bundle via the two-heptad repeat domain [e].<br>

Combining in situ measurements and computational fluid dynamics simulations,<br>
engineers quantify particles exhaled by normal respiratory behaviors<br>
and their transport under elevator, small classroom, and supermarket settings<br>
to evaluate the risk of inhaling potentially virus-containing particles.<br>
Only 10% of aerosols were filtered out in a simulation<br>

"Because this is very strong ventilation, we thought it would ventilate out a lot of aerosols.<br>

Cancer is essentially a malfunctioning of cellular machinery that causes runaway cell growth.<br>
Viruses also change the function of cellular machinery, but instead of causing cell growth,<br>
machinery is repurposed to reproduce viruses, taking control over many kinases to do this.<br>
Among the better understood 97 of 518 human kinases, the virus was found to affect 49.<br>
87 existing drugs were found to change kinase-controlled pathways used by SARS-CoV-2<br>

silmitasertib, gilteritinib, ralimetinib, apilimod and dinaciclib are either approved,<br>
in clinical testing or under preclinical development for treatment of various diseases.<br>

The number of new coronavirus cases in the U.S. shot up by over 20% per week for the past month.<br>
This week, it rose by a comparatively modest 7%.&nbsp That doesn't mean we're getting better.<br>
The U.S. may be leveling off, but it's leveling off at a very high rate of infection.<br>
The country is averaging roughly 66,000 new cases per day.<br>

"Integrating IAQ control strategies to reduce the risk of asymptomatic SARS CoV-2 infections<br>
 in classrooms and open plan offices." three-step plan:<ol compact>
<li> "To reduce the number of virus-containing aerosols emitted to the space<br>
  from any possible virus carriers present, universal face masking,<br>
   as well as hand sanitizing before entering the space is essential."<br>
<li> "Mechanically ventilated classrooms and offices typically have<br>
  about 20% of their air supplied from outdoors, and the rest is recirculated air...<br>
  the outdoor ventilation rate should be increased to the maximum operational capacity<br>
  of the building ventilation system, which can be two or more times of that<br>
  under the normal operation mode per the existing standard."<br>
<li> At the building level, high efficiency particulate (HEPA) filters in recirculated<br>
  or mixed air duct can reduce cross contamination between rooms<br>
  and increase total clean air delivery rates (outdoor plus filtered air)<br>
  for diluting virus concentrations in ventilated spaces.<br>
  An air cleaner with a CADR of 722 m3/h (425 CFM) can double the clean air supply<br>
  for 25 people in a classroom or open plan office.<br>

Widespread thromboses and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) are reported in COVID-19 patients.<br>
Key features of this disorder include a lack of bleeding risk,<br>
only mildly low platelet counts, elevated plasma fibrinogen levels,<br>
and detection of both SARS-CoV-2 and complement components in regions of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA).<br>
This disorder is not typical DIC and might be more similar to complement-mediated TMA syndromes,<br>
which are well known to rheumatologists who care for patients<br>
with severe systemic lupus erythematosus or catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome.<br>
This perspective has critical implications for treatment.&nbsp Standard treatments for DIC<br>
are gravely insufficient for any of the TMA disorders that involve disorders of complement.<br>

Using influenza surveillance networks to estimate state-specific prevalence of SARS-CoV-2<br>
Silverman et al. used data collected through an existing infrastructure<br>
for reporting influenza-like illness (ILI)<br>
to estimate the actual prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in states.<br>
Their model estimated that more than 80% of U.S. COVID-19 infections went undetected in March 2020.<br>
They identified excess ILI cases by first subtracting cases due to influenza<br>
and then subtracting the seasonal signal of non-influenza ILI.<br>
A 4-day lag between the onset of infectiousness and presentation with ILI<br>
yields a clinical rate of 25% among the 87% of simulations,<br>
which could account for the ILI surge.<br>

Masks can mitigate risk of COVID-19 'super spreaders' in rooms<br>
A severely infected person who's coughing frequently can fill a poorly ventilated room<br>
with as many as 7.4 million copies of the coronavirus for every cubic meter of air.<br>
"...individuals may be at risk of infection if they spend more than a few minutes<br>
 in a small room with a person who is infected with COVID-19..."<br>
"Swiss researchers gathered data from a handful of prior studies that tracked<br>
how much coronavirus the average infected person will emit by breathing normally,<br>
as well as the virus released by a very sick person who's coughing frequently.<br>
The team then used a mathematical model to estimate how much virus<br>
either a low- or high-emitting patient is likely to release into the air of a closed room.<br>
While engaged in activities like loud speaking or singing,<br>
viral emissions can increase by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude, the researchers said.<br>
People at rest tend to breathe in about a half a cubic meter of air every hour.<br>

[ plenty more from where coronavirus came ]<br>
Using 3 different bioinformatic approaches to identify and remove recombinant regions<br>
within the SARS-CoV-2 genome, researchers found that,<br>
although SARS-CoV-2 is genetically about 96% similar to the RaTG13 coronavirus,<br>
which was sampled from a Rhinolophus affinis horseshoe bat in 2013 in Yunnan province, China,<br>
the team found that it diverged from RaTG13 in 1969.<br>
"other viruses that are capable of infecting humans are circulating in horseshoe bats in China"<br>
"SARS-CoV-2's RBD sequence has so far only been found in a few pangolin viruses.<br>
Furthermore, the other key feature thought to be instrumental to SARS-CoV-2's ability to infect humans<br>
 - a polybasic cleavage site insertion in the Spike protein -<br>
has not yet been seen in another close bat relative of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.<br>
Yet, while it is possible that pangolins may have acted as an intermediate host<br>
 facilitating transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to humans, no evidence exists to suggest that<br>
 pangolin infection is a requirement for bat viruses to cross into humans.&nbsp Instead,<br>
 our research suggests that SARS-CoV-2 likely evolved the ability<br>
 to replicate in the upper respiratory tract of both humans and pangolins."<br>

Using the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Summit supercomputer to analyze genes<br>

<b>pandemic engineering (slow Sunday)</b><br>
Pandemic spread is driven by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fokker%E2%80%93Planck_equation">diffusion</a>: &nbsp
<img align=center src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/FokkerPlanck.gif"><br clear=all>
An essential bit about diffusion is that flux (AKA magnitude and direction of flow )<br>
is linearly proportional to density gradient of diffusing material concentration.<br>
<br>
Diffusion gets complicated by geometries and nonuniformities,<br>
so let's back off and use engineering approximations e.g. from electronics,<br>
with electrons analogous to viral particles and electrical potential analogous to particle density.<br>
One electrical property, capacitance <code>C</code>, is defined as the ratio of electron charge to potential:<br>
<code>C = Q / V or V = Q / C</code>.<br>
In this analogy, a specific human's breathing system has relatively constant capacity,<br>
and potential to diffuse viral particles is proportional to instantaneous particle concentration.<br>
<br>
Another well-known electrical law was named after Georg Ohm:<br>
<code>V = I * R</code>, where <code>I</code> is time rate of change in charge: <code>I = Q / T</code><br>
.. and R is resistance to that change.<br>
Applied to our specific human, exhaling into a vacuum,<br>
which represents practically no resistance,<br>
initial flux would be very large while particle density<br>
(along with survival odds) would quickly approach zero.<br>
Alternatively, attempting to exhale into high water pressure encounters higher resistance,<br>
although viral particles would readily diffuse into that water,<br>
provided that water initially has relatively low viral particle concentration.<br>
<br>
Electrical power (AKA energy flow) <code>P = I*V = I*I*R = V*V/R</code><br>
Perhaps unintuitively, no power is consumed even for large current flows<br>
where there is no resistance.&nbsp On the other hand,<br>
even a small potential into a smaller resistance consumes substantial power.<br>
<br>
Much of electrical engineering involves one dimensional flows,<br>
with electron flows into near ends of conductors equal those at far ends.<br>
However, antenna radiation involves 3-dimensional geometry<br>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law">inverse square law</a>
with an implicit assumption of free space,<br>
which is emphatically NOT applicable for viral transmission indoors.<br>
An inverse-square relationship arises from consideration that<br>
flow thru one surface is spread over 4 times the area of another surface with twice the diameter,<br>
with another implicit assumption that flow continues onword, uninterrupted.<br>
<br>
This distancing effect is essentially nullified in effectively closed indoor spaces,<br>
where transmission is mostly determined by duration of exposure and source flow rate.<br>
<br>
Back to antennas: given directionality, radio engineers think in terms of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_radiated_power">ERP</a><br>
.. 3 feet behind a COVID-19 carrier may be safer than 6 feet in front.<br>
<br>
Back to the capacitor analogy: COVID-19 patients have relatively fixed capacities<br>
but are also relatively constant viral generators.&nbsp Consequently,<br>
larger, quiet, and inactive nose breathers may accumulate higher concentrations<br>
than smaller, noisy, active mouth breathers (AKA children).&nbsp Higher concentrations presumably<br>
promote more reinfection as well as contagion when they do speak, sneeze or sing.<br>
<br>
I speculate that one is unlikely to become sick by inhaling a single SARS-CoV-2 virus.<br>
I'll even speculate that very small doses may help develop immunity with minimal symptoms.<br>
Conversely, there may be an optimal spacing and duration for a single COVID-19 patient<br>
to most efficiently infect others, which is analogous to matching electrical impedances for maximum power flow.<br>
<br>
Motivation for writing this includes an insight that<br>
SARS-CoV-2 transmission power is probably related to the square of viral concentration,<br>
just as electrical power is proportional to the square of potential<br>
(for a constant system impedance).<br>
That nonlinear effect would help explain super-spreaders..<br>

Wrong but Useful - What Covid-19 Epidemiologic Models Can and Cannot Tell Us<br>
Covid-19 modeling studies generally follow one of two general approaches<br>
that we will refer to here as forecasting models and mechanistic models.<br>
Although there are hybrid approaches, these two model types tend to address<br>
different questions on different time scales, and they deal differently with uncertainty.<br>
Forecasting models are often statistical in nature,<br>
fitting a line or curve to data and extrapolating from there<br>
The original versions of the controversial model<br>
from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) fell into this category<br>
Mechanistic models, like the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered frameworks,<br>
mimic the way SARS-CoV-2 spreads and can be used to forecast or simulate future transmission scenarios<br>
under various assumptions about parameters governing transmission, disease, and immunity.<br>
Unlike purely statistical models, mechanistic approaches include important feedback<br>
- the more people become infected, the faster disease spreads.<br>
In fact, many parameters associated with Covid-19 transmission are poorly understood.<br>
The resulting model uncertainty is not always calculated or reported in a standardized way.<br>

Arrayed imaging reflectometry starts with a strong anti-reflective coating<br>
spread across the surface of a standard-shaped well plate<br>
that captures and deflects as much light as possible.<br>
Capture probes are arrayed on top to bind with a range of different target molecules.<br>
After adding a sample, a laser is used to scan each well.<br>
As more target molecules bind to the surface, more light is reflected and captured,<br>
delivering a clear signal of whatever is present in one step<br>
- such as antibodies for the novel coronavirus or other diseases,<br>
or the cytokine regulators of the body's immune system.<br>
Planned for August release, Adarza Biosystems is in the midst of beta testing<br>

Host-directed therapy uses the body's own immune system to deal with the infection.<br>
A Trinity College Dublin research team repurposed SAHA,<br>
an epigenetic inhibitor approved for cancer treatment,<br>
to stop production of an anti-inflammatory signal<br>
while at the same time promoting more appropriate pro-inflammatory signals<br>
that may help the patient to clear the infection.<br>
Importantly, this fine-tuning of the immune response<br>
early in the reaction to infection also benefits later immune responses,<br>
which may also aid in the design of future vaccine strategies.<br>

<dd><b>three distinct immune responses for COVID-19 patients</b><br>
The first immunotype had robust CD4+ T cell activity,<br>
with modest activation of CD8+ T cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes.<br>
CD4+ and CD8+ act as the main inflammatory immune cells that work to clear viruses.<br>
The second immunotype was characterized mainly by<br>
a subset of CD8+ T cells known as EM and EMRA<br>
and a modest activation of CD8+ T cells, memory B cells, and peripheral blood lymphocytes.<br>
The third immunotype showed little to no evidence of an immune response to the infection.<br>
The first immunotype was tied to more severe disease<br>
 that included inflammation, organ failure, and acute kidney disease.<br>
The second correlated not with disease severity<br>
but instead pre-existing immunosuppression and mortality.<br>
The third type was not associated with specific symptoms or clinical features,<br>
though they varied.<br>

Hebrew University of Jerusalem (HU)'s Professor Yaakov Nahmias and Dr. Benjamin tenOever<br>
at New York's Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai<br>
observed that SARS-CoV-2 prevents routine burning of carbohydrates,<br>
with fat accumulating inside lung cells, which may help<br>
explain why patients with high blood sugar and cholesterol levels are often at a particularly<br>
high risk to develop COVID-19. "By understanding how the SARS-CoV-2 controls our<br>
 metabolism, we can wrestle back control from the virus<br>
 and deprive it from the very resources it needs to survive."<br>
In lab studies, cholesterol-lowering drug Fenofibrate (Tricor) showed promising results.<br>
By allowing lung cells to burn more fat, fenofibrate prevents SARS CoV-2's reproduction.<br>
Within only five days of treatment, the virus almost completely disappeared.<br>

SARS-CoV2 vaccines: Slow is fast<br>
Phase 3 trials are necessarily time consuming and require that<br>
infection among the control group is sufficiently high to draw a conclusion.<br>
In 1966, a large trial of a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) found that<br>
the immunized cohort actually faired significantly worse upon infection.<br>
There is some reason to worry that the same may occur with some SARS-CoV2 vaccines.<br>
Any immune response is of two types, adaptive or innate.<br>
Adaptive immunity is elicited by most vaccines and is mediated by lymphocytes.<br>
With the failed RSV vaccine, a lack of antibody affinity maturation caused the negative effect.<br>
There are potential reasons why an immune response to a vaccine can predispose an individual<br>
to a worse outcome upon infection.&nbsp One is the phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE).<br>
Troublingly, ADE has also been seen with vaccines for a feline coronavirus (6, 7).<br>
There is also evidence for ADE in SARS-CoV.<br>

people think that Covid Consultants are going to come into our place of work<br>

The University of Oxford and its research center in China are launching Oxsed Limited,<br>
a new company to develop a rapid COVID-19 test that could cost about $25 U.S.<br>
"Our test is ideal for use in community or field settings by laypersons<br>
 and allows immediate decisions to be made"<br>
The single-step test generates a colored result in 30 to 45 minutes from a throat or nasal swab,<br>
 and can be read by the naked eye or a digital instrument.<br>
The simplified viral RNA test is based on RT-LAMP technology,<br>
for reverse transcription, loop-mediated isothermal amplification.<br>
The method uses less hardware than the PCR-based coronavirus lab tests in widespread use,<br>
which can require dozens of cycles of heating and cooling to drive the DNA reactions.<br>
"An advantage of using LAMP technology is that<br>
 it uses different reagents to most laboratory-based PCR tests"<br>

only 10% to 15% of the population was likely to be immune.<br>
"And immunity to this thing looks rather fragile - it looks like some people might have<br>
 antibodies for a few months and then it might wane, so it's not looking like a safe bet"<br>

Saliva test is less sensitive than swab (more false negatives)<br>
The gold standard for detecting SARS-CoV-2 is a polymerase chain reaction (PCR).<br>
Both saliva and swab tests employ PCR, and saliva has several advantages:<br>
it is easier and less uncomfortable to take<br>
health-care workers may not need to collect<br>
reduced consumption of PPE and swabs, which might be in short supply<br>
However, a recent meta-analysis (not yet peer-reviewed) has shown<br>
detection from saliva is 13% less sensitive than a nasal swab<br>

To propagate, SARS-CoV-2's RNA-dependent polymerase (RdRp) is indispensable<br>
 for replicating its genome and generating additional RNAs via transcription.<br>
To treat Ebola, Gilead Sciences developed 'Remdesivir', an adenosine nucleotide analog chain terminator for RdRps,<br>
which incorporated into nascent viral RNA causes premature termination of viral-specific transcription.<br>
In both Gilead's uncontrolled study and NIH's double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial study,<br>
therapy with Remdesivir reduced recovery time for hospitalized patients with advanced COVID-19.<br>
10-day versus 5-day regimens of Remdesivir demonstrated similar positive outcomes,<br>
suggesting drug efficacy in a shorter time of therapy.<br>

Fauci:   "What we've seen over the last several days is a spike in cases<br>
&nbsp that is way beyond the worst spikes that we have seen.<br>
&nbsp We've got to get that under control, or we risk an even greater outbreak in the United States.<br>
&nbsp In the United States, even in the most strict lockdowns, only about 50% of the country locked down<br>
&nbsp -- that allowed for the perpetuation of the outbreak, which we never did get under very good control."<br>

Controlled Human Infection Models (CHIMs) are inappropriate for COVID-19<br>
CHIMs require infecting healthy persons with a well-characterized microorganis<br>
in order to study pathogenesis, characterize the immune response,<br>
and elucidate the efficacy of vaccines or therapeutics.   By design,<br>
the controlled nature of CHIMs limits their generalizability<br>
for predicting the effectiveness of a vaccine candidate against natural exposure.<br>
A model of disease in healthy young volunteers may have questionable scientific validity<br>
when extrapolated to older or other at-risk populations that have disproportionate morbidity.<br>
Moreover, correlates of protection from SARS-CoV-2 are poorly understood<br>
and may vary with the population or the vaccine construct.<br>
Virtually all recent CHIMs have involved microorganisms that either<br>
pose minimal risk for causing severe disease in the enrolled population,<br>
have effective oral treatments, or both.   Currently,<br>
we lack sufficient knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis<br>
to inform inclusion and exclusion criteria for a SARS-CoV-2 CHIM.<br>
A single death or severe illness in an otherwise healthy volunteer<br>
would be unconscionable and would halt progress.<br>

Kids and COVID-19:  what we know, what we kind of know,<br>
and what we need to do to know more.<br>
They are less likely to contract the disease, and if they do contract it,<br>
they are more likely to have a mild or asymptomatic case.<br>
Death rates are much lower.<br>
Children seem to transmit the virus less than do adults.<br>
Data from the Netherlands suggest that<br>
children are relatively unlikely to be the first case in a family cluster.<br>
School staff are not more likely than other occupations to contract the disease.<br>
Preschool and high-school teachers are actually less likely to get COVID-19.<br>
The highest-risk group here is drivers - of taxis and buses in particular.<br>

"We hit the wall three weeks ago,"<br>
said Jon Cohen, executive chairman of BioReference Laboratories.<br>
In mid-June, four changes hit all at once, Cohen said.<br>
Large companies began to test their employees en masse,<br>
hospitals started to test every patient who needed an elective procedure,<br>
and nursing homes started regularly testing employees and some residents.<br>
The public also seemed to seek out voluntary tests in greater numbers.<br>
"Our modeling efforts more or less show that, if you don't get results back in a day or so,<br>
outbreaks really can't be stopped without isolating and quarantining all contacts preemptively."<br>

Common human respiratory coronaviruses infections are highly seasonal<br>
For 10 years, researchers from the University of Michigan (UM) School of Public Health<br>
have tracked occurrences of 4 types of human coronaviruses (OC43, 229E, HKU1, and NL63)<br>
in 890 to 1,441 individuals from 209 to 340 participating households and now track SARS-CoV-2.<br>
When year-round surveillance was in place, most coronaviruses cases were detected<br>
between December and April/May and peaked in January/February.<br>
Only 2.5% of cases occurred between June and September.<br>

Coronavirus and cancer hijack the same parts in human cells to spread:<br>
Existing cancer drugs could fight COVID-19.<br>
Viruses take control over many kinases to produce more viruses.<br>
Of 97 kinases tested, coronavirus affects 49.<br>
Of 87 existing drugs that change the kinase-controlled pathways used by the coronavirus,<br>
several were effective in killing the virus in cells.&nbsp A few<br>
 - silmitasertib, gilteritinib, ralimetinib, apilimod and dinaciclib - are either approved for treatment,<br>
in clinical testing or under preclinical development for various diseases.<br>

Harvard public health experts said the nation's COVID-19 epidemic is getting "quite out of hand"<br>
and that, with cases rising rapidly in the hardest-hit states and a two-week lag<br>
between infection and hospitalization, the situation appears set to worsen quickly.<br>
"The increases that we're seeing right now have the capacity to cause far more disease in the future,"<br>
said William Hanage, associate professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.<br>

A study from researchers at La Jolla Institute for Immunology and Erasmus University Medical Center<br>
shows that even the sickest COVID-19 patients produce T cells that help fight the virus.<br>
"Activating these cells appears to be at least as important as the production of antibodies,"<br>
says Erasmus MC Virologist Rory de Vries, Ph.D., who co-led the study.<br>

Coronavirus mutation has taken over<br>
When the first coronavirus cases in Chicago appeared in January,<br>
they bore the same genetic signatures as a germ that emerged in China weeks before.<br>
By May, a mutation associated with outbreaks in Europe and was found in 95% of all the genomes sequenced.<br>
Of approximately 50,000 genomes of the new virus that researchers worldwide have uploaded to a shared database,<br>
about 70% carry the mutation, officially designated D614G.&nbsp   The mutation doesn't appear to make people sicker,<br>
but a growing number of scientists worry that it has made the virus more contagious.<br>

Researchers are working to develop cloth that could inactivate or repel coronaviruses<br>
Polyester material is printed with alternating spots of silver and zinc resembling polka dots<br>
one to two millimeters wide and spaced one millimeter apart.<br>
This "electroceutical" material functions as an ordinary fabric when dry, but if dampened<br>
- say, with saliva, vapor from a coughed up droplet or other bodily fluids -<br>
ions in the liquid trigger an electrochemical reaction.<br>
The silver and zinc then generate a weak electric field that zaps pathogens on the surface.<br>
A study posted on the preprint server ChemRxiv reported that<br>
its electroceutical fabric destabilized a coronavirus strain that causes<br>
a respiratory illness in pigs and on an unrelated type of pathogen called a lentivirus,<br>
leaving them unable to infect cells.<br>

Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and other cities across the country have not seen the sharp, sustained spikes<br>

Numerous studies support this.&nbsp Japanese researchers, for example,<br>
found coronavirus transmission indoors about 19 times greater than in the open air.<br>

DIY COVID-19 vaccine<br>
<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/05/19/science.abc6284">
A May Science paper</a> showed that a DNA vaccine seemed to provoke an immune response against SARS-CoV-2.<br>
The researchers developed multiple vaccines expressing different forms of the virus' spike protein and tested them in monkeys.<br>
Josiah Zayner and collaborators in Mississippi and Ukraine want to reproduce that experiment<br>
in humans - themselves - and livestream the process over several weeks.<br>
The scheme, dubbed Project McAfee, after the antivirus software, is possible thanks to the availability<br>
of new tools and technologies - including viral DNA - to the general public.<br>
The same spike protein used by researchers in their vaccine was ordered<br>
from a DNA synthesis company, having it put in a solution that could be injected.<br>

Far-UVC light (222 nm wavelength) penetrates neither eyes' tear layer nor skin's outer dead-cell layer,<br>
so it cannot damage living cells in the body,<br>

Continuous exposure to far-UVC light at the current regulatory limit is estimated to kill<br>

aimed at keeping temperatures at a cool 6-10 degrees Celsius<br>
but continually recycling the same untreated air into the room,<br>
helped spread the coronavirus among hundreds of workers,<br>
a hygiene expert said Wednesday,<br>
a day after the mass outbreak triggered renewed lockdowns in the area.<br>
"The technology is there" to fix the problem, he said, pointing to<br>
high-performance mobile air filters that remove pollutants<br>
or the microbe-killing UV lights that are used in hospital air conditioning systems.<br>

About an hour after top public health officials denied that President Trump had ordered a slowdown in COVID-19 testing,<br>
news broke that the federal government was winding down support for local testing sites in states like Texas that continue to break daily case records.<br>
Dallas County, which has the second-highest number of cases in the state,<br>
will lose federal assistance at two testing sites, according to Rocky Vaz, director of emergency management.<br>
The city of Dallas would end up paying between $130 and $150 per test once federal help ends.<br>
Each site can perform 1,000 COVID tests per day.<br>

Herd immunity model accounting for population heterogeneity<br>
Classic herd immunity HC is 60% immunization for homogeneous populations and R0 = 2.5:<br>
HC = 1 - 1/R0<br>
Considered heterogeneously, e.g. with more vs less interactions within population segments,<br>
then immunities level HD within those differentiated herds can be lower,<br>
e.g. HD = 43% for R0 = 2.5.<br>
Varying interactions between segments further differentiates immunity levels.<br>

Combining recent methods of fast nucleic acid amplification to screen for SARS-CoV-2<br>
with rapid RNA extraction cuts total detection time to 3.5 minutes from swab to diagnosis.<br>
"[Polymerase chain reaction], a common methodology in research and clinical laboratories,<br>
is slow, but sensitive.  Antigen-based testing is fast, but not very sensitive.<br>

How States With Rising Coronavirus Cases Are Responding<br>
Oregon Governor Kate Brown, a Democrat, and Utah Governor Gary Herbert, a Republican,<br>
have each paused their state's phased reopening plans in response to the increases.<br>
But other Republican governors - Ducey in Arizona, Greg Abbott in Texas, and Ron DeSantis<br>
in Florida among them - have refused to reimpose economic restrictions or social-distancing mandates,<br>
in many cases frustrating local leaders, whose hands are tied.<br>

Dexamethasone, a cheap, widely available corticosteroid,<br>
significantly reduced deaths of severely sick COVID-19 patients in a major clinical trial.<br>
They did not find any benefit in patients not receiving respiratory support.<br>
Dexamethasone's effect is seemingly much stronger than that of remdesivir.<br>

COVID-19 vaccine trials: "It's really complicated."</a></b><br>
1) Populations that have high levels of viral transmission are a moving target.<br>
 &nbsp Moderna's vaccine will enroll 30,000 people and take place<br>
 &nbsp primarily at U.S. hospitals and universities<br>
 &nbsp long used for HIV and flu vaccine testing<br>
 &nbsp and now overseen by Warp Speed's COVID-19 Prevention Network.<br>
 &nbsp But which of those brick-and-mortar sites will have enough SARS-CoV-2<br>
 &nbsp circulating near them to quickly produce an efficacy signal is uncertain<br>
 &nbsp given the shifting distribution of new cases in the United States.<br>
 &nbsp Beijing's Sinovac Biotech will stage efficacy trials of its vaccine candidate in Brazil,<br>
 &nbsp where the COVID-19 epidemic is now raging.<br>
<br>
2) Competition among trial efforts could hinder the global push.<br>
 &nbsp "everybody loves to collaborate unless they want to win"<br>
 &nbsp WHO has yet to announce its Solidarity test candidates, but,<br>
 &nbsp unlike Warp Speed "which won't consider Chinese-made vaccines"<br>
 &nbsp * it is open to products from every country, and<br>
 &nbsp * publicized detailed criteria for how it will prioritize vaccines.<br>
<br>
Sinovac Biotech announced preliminary study results on Saturday<br>
showing its experimental Covid-19 vaccine generated immune responses<br>
in "above 90%" of patients and was safe.<br>

There are only 200 million vials left in the world because they've all been bought up.<br>
One in 10 new drugs make it to market;&nbsp  the U.S. has funded only 2 for COVID-19.<br>
An estimated $26 billion is needed to start producing the 10 most promising vaccines now.<br>
Existing production facilities are highly specialized for making a single, specific type of vaccine,
<br>like polio or measles, and they are currently reserved to make those vaccines.<br>
If those facilities are repurposed to make a new COVID-19 vaccine,<br>
it will put the supply of other critical vaccines at risk.<br>

treatment should be based on 3 COVID-19 phases<br>
1) the virus multiplies inside the body<br>
   &nbsp and is likely to cause mild symptoms that may be confused with a common cold or flu.<br>
2) the immune system becomes strongly affected by infection<br>
    &nbsp with symptoms such as persistent cough, shortness of breath and low oxygen levels.<br>
    &nbsp Problems with blood clotting may predominate.<br>
3) hyperinflammatory phase:  injury to the heart, kidneys and other organs<br>
<br>
* Plasma containing antibodies from recovered COVID-19 patients (i.e., hyperimmune plasma),<br>
 &nbsp which has been found to reduce the amount of live virus (viral load) in the early infection phase.<br>
* Antiviral drugs, including remdesivir, which have helped interrupt viral replication in Phase 1<br>
 &nbsp  and may continue to be beneficial in Phase 2.<br>
* Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA).&nbsp A drug used to treat stroke,<br>
  &nbsp tPA breaks up blood clots that may occur during Phase 2.<br>
* Inflammation-fighting medications, including corticosteroids, tocilizumab and sarilumab.<br>
  &nbsp These may help reduce system-wide inflammation in Phases 2 and 3.<br>
* The anticoagulant (anti-clotting drug) heparin is important during any stage of the disease<br>
 &nbsp  to prevent blood clots in blood vessels and capillaries (micro- and macro-vascular thrombosis).<br>

Four main treatment classes are being explored to fight COVID-19<br>
 by either inhibiting the virus or modulating the body's response to it:<br>
1) antiviral drugs, to inhibit viral replication;<br>
2) immunomodulatory drugs, to dampen an immune system in overdrive;<br>
3) neutralizing antibodies, to inhibit the virus and help the immune system clear the infection;<br>
4) sera (the acellular fraction of circulating blood containing a wide range of antibodies,<br>
cytokines and other immunomodulators) from patients who have recovered from COVID-19.<br>

A noncompeting pair of human antibodies block COVID-19 virus binding to its receptor ACE2<br>
Two antibodies, B38 and H4, blocked the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein<br>
 from binding to the cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).<br>
The B38-binding site overlaps with the binding site for ACE2.<br>
Although H4 also blocks RBD binding to ACE2, it binds at a different site,<br>
and thus the two antibodies can bind simultaneously.<br>

Sofosbuvir as a potential alternative SARS-CoV-2 treatment<br>
The most highly conserved protein in all known RNA viruses is the viral monomeric RdRp.<br>
Several drugs that bind to the RdRp active site are approved to treat RNA viral diseases,<br>
 including Remdesivir, recently proven effective blocking SARS-CoV-2.<br>
Sofosbuvir (SOF) is a nucleotide analogue targeted against the HCV polymerase, NS5B.<br>
Previous work shows SOF has in vitro and/or in vivo antiviral activity against other Flaviviruses.<br>
SOF already has approval as a standard treatment and a well-known safety profile;<br>
 it would be interesting to develop in vitro experiments to test its efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2<br>

What this coronavirus does to your body that makes it so deadly<br>
A coronavirus infection usually plays out one of two ways:<br>
 as a lung infection that includes some cases of what people would call the common cold,<br>
 or as an infection in the gut that causes diarrhea.<br>
COVID-19 starts out in lungs like common cold coronaviruses,<br>
but then causes havoc with the immune system.  It has many more ways<br>
than does influenza to stop cells from calling out to the immune system for help.<br>

Putting the Public Back in Public Health<br>
"Although decisions to gradually reopen societies are ultimately based on<br>
 a complex calculus of political, economic, and public health considerations, it's clear that<br>
 there is a high unmet need for better estimates of communities' burden of Covid-19<br>
 to guide such decision making.&nbsp Fortunately, some mobile symptom-surveillance tools<br>
 can be used for predictive modeling to address this critical priority."<br>

"... holding officials accountable for demonstrating that orders are reasonable and necessary<br>
 - has been a robust scaffold for assessing the legality of public health orders<br>
 for more than a century, since it was announced in the seminal Supreme Court case of<br>
 Jacobson v. Massachusetts.&nbsp In addition to recognizing the need to give officials flexibility<br>
 to implement forceful public health interventions, Jacobson recognized that<br>
 administrative agencies are both nimbler and more expert than legislatures.<br>
 In upending this framework, the Wisconsin court did more than<br>
 disrupt settled understandings of the law: it hobbled the state's ability to save lives."<br>

re: famotidine<br>
Faithful readers may recall from a month ago that,<br>
 motivated by anecdotal Chinese results for this common gastric acid suppression remedy,<br>
  Northwell Health used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famotidine">famotidine</a> to reduce intubation and death rates from 22% to 10%.<br>

<a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-30934/v1">
https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-30934/v1</a><br>
"The most straightforward explanation of the apparent famotidine activity as a COVID-19 therapy<br>
&nbsp;is that the drug acts via its antagonism or inverse-agonism of histamine signaling<br>
&nbsp;and via its arrestin biased activation - all a result of its binding to [histamine] H2.<br>
&nbsp;If true, then it is reasonable to infer that a SARS-CoV-2 infection<br>
&nbsp;that results in COVID-19 is at least partially mediated by pathologic histamine release."<br>

<b>bias</b><br>
> Everybody has a bias and it clouds their judgement.<br>
<br>
My bias is pessimistic, but<br>
I agree that is important for schools to reopen and worth some risk.<br>
What I suggested to my daughter for Northern VA schools,<br>
is that they consider allowing kids capable of remote learning to do so,<br>
freeing up some space to spread out those who cannot.<br>
<br>
The other key would be aggressive tracing and quarantining of new cases.<br>
Schools and parents would have to be prepared for students to be<br>
removed from classes and isolated immediately on suspicion of infection.<br>
<br>
I doubt whether many schools could open enough windows to adequately<br>
circulate air, even if clothing to keep kids comfortable were available.<br>
Most schools could never maintain HVAC filtration adequate to filter virus.<br>
Probably a lot of teachers speaking thru masks could not be understood,<br>
but even if teachers somehow avoided catching COVID-19 from asymptomatic kids,<br>
too many of those kids will probably take the virus home and kill baby-sitting elders.<br>
<br>
Other than having also written for Breitbart and other ultra-conservative media,<br>
I know nothing about this Daniel Horowitz (not the lawyer) other than what he has written,<br>
but I question whether he actually believes even half the stuff opined under his byline.<br>
FWIW, credible journalism generally does not cite sources such as <code>Gummi Bear</code> on <i>twitter</i>.<br>
While anonymous sources can be important, substantive confirmation is wanted.<br>
<br>
Beyond that,<br>
4 Canadian infectious disease self-proclaimed "experts" are not necessarily epidemiologists;<br>
they may be expert at treating infections without competence at managing viral outbreaks.<br>
It was, after all, an OPINION piece, not research.<br>
Those Canadians did publish that 95% of COVID-19 deaths are among those over 60.<br>

Without better treatments and/or vaccination[s],<br>
chances of our being able to indefinitely avoid contracting the virus
eventually approach zero.<br>
Where statistically significant antibody testing has been conducted to evaluate rates of asymptomatic to verified cases,<br>
NY had about 14% with antibodies as of Apr 23.<br>
Those take weeks to develop;&nbsp  NY had about 130K reported cases around April 1,<br>
 which is about 0.67% of population, so a 20:1 ratio.  Other places have estimated 6:1.<br>
<br>
That would put our risk of dying between 0.38% and 1.3%, provided that hospitals are not overwhelmed.<br>
On the other hand, I have not seen authoratative age breakdown for antibodies vs confirmed, but I suppose<br>
that less than half those our age get infected without serious symptoms,<br>
which gets us back nearer 8% risk of dying, again supposing hospitals not overwhelmed.<br>
<br>
New York City had 4 times the normal number of deaths, keeping in mind that its hospitals were NOT overwhelmed:<br>

<b>replacing animation by color coding</b><br>
IMO, identifying locations with increasing rates of infections<br>
is as important as comparing per capita new infections, but<br>
implementing that by animation felt clumsy.<br>
While switching from Johns Hopkins to USA facts<br>
(which data seems better, but formatted differently)<br>
I also decided to instead color-code most recent 3-day case increases:<br>
* pale red means latest 3-day increase is no greater than that for previous 3 days<br>
* dark red means latest increase is greater, perhaps growing out of control:<br>
New case rate changes can in theory be deduced by comparing red to  orange,<br>
but logarithmic distortion visually confounds that.  For example,<br>
compare relative sizes of red and orange section for NYC boroughs.<br>

Anyone you spend greater than 10 minutes with face-to-face is potentially infected.<br>

At least 44% of all infections--and a majority of community-acquired transmissions--occur from people without symptoms.<br>
   20% of infected people are responsible for 99% of viral loads.<br>

Biggest outbreaks are in prisons, religious ceremonies, and workplaces<br>

dark enough to go back to work.<br>

<br>
There is no real solution until vaccine and/or effective treatment and/or herd (what is left of it) immunity.<br>
Until then, this is mostly about the rate at which vulnerable get infected.<br>
As Fauci notes,
"The idea of having treatments available or a vaccine to facilitate
the re-entry of students into the fall term<br>
 would be something that would be a bit of a bridge too far."<br>
<br>
While most freak about exposing kids,<br>
numbers to date suggest they are less at risk than most others,<br>
and weird provisions that many workers would make instead of sending
them to school,<br>
such as baby-sitting by grandparents or unlicensed daycare, could have
worse outcomes.<br>
<br>
Perhaps a better approach is to let kids over 12 or so remote learn,<br>
then spread younger students among classrooms unused by teens.<br>
<br>
> NY is advertising free testing, no symptoms necessary to qualify on the news tonight.<br>
<br>
Great, that is presumably thanks to NY having developed their own tests.<br>
VA has sharply reduced testing, despite major growth in northern VA cases.<br>
Many spread the infection for a week before showing symptoms.<br>
NY also wants a better handle on what percentage have antibodies.<br>
<br>
Monday, VA had 989 positive results from 7562 tests, of which almost certainly most were of health workers.<br>
<br>
Similarly for SC<br>

would smooth such results but delay showing serious increases,<br>

NY Gov. Cuomo identified 70% hospital capacity as a threshold for shelter in place;<br>
this article identifies tracing capacity as a key constraint for keeping it below 70%.<br>

It is a long read;&nbsp  to summarize:<br>
without an app based on Google/Apple smartphone tracing,<br>
this pandemic continues until immunity, which requires either:<br>
* vaccine[s], or<br>
* a majority having contracted it and, lacking effective treatments:<br>
   - deaths of most vulnerable 1-2 million U.S. residents, which is<br>
      ~ 2/3 of annual deaths from all causes.<br>

&gt; If you are to summarize all of your research<br>
&gt; do you think this boils down to a much worse second wave?
<br>
I watch daily briefings by NY Gov Cuomo, who points out<br>
that depends on how folks behave.  Just as with the first wave,<br>
localities will experience it at different times and strengths.<br>
<br>
I >>SUSPECT<< that, in much of the country,<br>
even if/when states implement tracing,<br>
many of those contacted and directed to isolate will NOT.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, if Trump prevails in forcing meat packers to reopen,<br>
a second wave in those communities will overwhelm their health systems<br>
and undertakers.  On the other hand, they will develop herd immunities...<br>
<br>
I expect a second wave here, starting around May 15,<br>
as vacationers pile into Hilton Head.<br>
With summer tourists continually arriving and leaving,<br>
appreciable herd immunity may not evolve.<br>
<br>
Since it is to me unclear whether/how much infection was spread in schools,<br>
I expect a second wave in some states to not wait for Fall<br>
and be indistinguishable from a prolonged first wave.<br>
<br>
My model suggests that 20% herd immunity may dampen a second wave,<br>
provided that infected populations are sufficiently depleted,<br>
which requires about 3 weeks of very few new cases.<br>
<br>
Refining my model wants more data and better visualizations;<br>
I am studying R and specifically tidyverse:<br>
https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html#prerequisites<br>
<br>
I suspect that Gov. Cuomo's 70% hospital occupancy threshold<br>
will prove to be sadly optimistic, given approx 10 day delays<br>
between infections and hospitalizations.  On the other hand,<br>
he may fear losing control by holding out for safer thresholds.<br>

<img width=600 src="https://sites.google.com/site/blekenbleu/Home/NYT.png"><br clear=all>
IMO, most recent 1 week would be more useful than 4 weeks..   Per-capita increases:<br>
.08% for Bluffton, SC;&nbsp  .06% for Auburn, NY,  .04% for Lexington, KY;<br>
.13% for Louisville;&nbsp  .08% for San Francisco;&nbsp  .07% for San Diego,  .14% for NYC<br>
.13% &amp .43% for Boulder &amp Greeley CO;&nbsp  .02% for Longview, WA;<br>
.08% for Austin, TX;&nbsp  .18% &amp .05% for St Louis &amp Jefferson City, MO<br>

<a href="https://covid.yale.edu/innovation/mapping/case-maps/population-density/">https://covid.yale.edu/innovation/mapping/case-maps/population-density/</a><br>

<img width=600 src="https://sites.google.com/site/blekenbleu/Home/yale.png"><br clear=all>
<br>
For example, 11% confirmed cases in Weld, CO implies significant herd immunity developing,<br>
which my model suggests could begin slowing growth within a month.<br>
Weld has intensive testing;&nbsp actual/confirmed is probably lower there than elsewhere.<br>
At 0.2%, Kershaw has highest cumulative cases in SC;<br>
6.5:1 actual to confirmed yields only 1.3%,  a long way from reducing growth.<br>
NYC reports 3.5% confirmed;&nbsp  antibody survey reported 21% (so 6:1);<br>
 partial herd immunity may be helping.<br>

<b>4.5% case growth;&nbsp Hospital Referral Regions (#HRRs)</b><br>
New case growth rate is basically a proxy for risk of infection.<br>
Mark Handley is another non-medical techie crunching statistics:<br>
<a href="http://nrg.cs.ucl.ac.uk/mjh/covid19/#covid-us-norm">http://nrg.cs.ucl.ac.uk/mjh/covid19/#covid-us-norm</a><br>
Note that graph is NOT new cases, and Mark shifted plots to match 4.5% tangents.<br>
It sort of suggests that it takes 20-30 days for recoveries to start
reducing case growth,<br>
then 10 days or so for increasing partial herd immunity to begin
reducing new case rate.<br>
<br>
Partial herd immunity may kick in so promptly because of
self-selection among most risky.<br>
<br>
Mark's next chart shows NEW case growth rate differences,<br>
presumably consequences of risk circumstances and behaviors<br>
(public transportation, urban/rural, local edicts):<br>

My primitive model suggests that, if NYC can get their hospitalization rate down,<br>
 then (supposing acquired immunity)  NYC's 20% reduction in susceptibility<br>
(AKA partial herd immunity) may make reopening there not much more risky than upstate,<br>
where contagion risk is lower, but over 96% remain susceptible.<br>
<br>
To avoid excess mortality, 'not much more risky' still IMO wants<br>
masks on everyone in public along with distancing, massive testing and tracing.<br>

<b>asthma sufferers strikingly underrepresented among COVID-19 deaths</b><br>
[ instead, blood clotting ]<br>
Nearly 8% of U.S. population has asthma.  When the novel coronavirus first hit,<br>
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others put people<br>
with asthma at the top of their lists of those who might be the most vulnerable.<br>
But European researchers writing in the journal Lancet noted<br>
it was <i>striking</i> how underrepresented asthma patients had been.<br>
<br>
Earlier this month, when New York state released data about<br>
the top chronic health problems of those who died of covid-19,<br>
asthma was not among them.<br>
Instead, they were almost all cardiovascular conditions.<br>

<dd><a name=MODEL><b>r[t], SIR model versus my SRC model</b><br></a>
I am no doctor, but then doctors are not engineers..<br>
<br>
r[0] supposes that, given a population with no resistance at time t=0,<br>
there is a meaningful ratio for<br>
<i>how many others will catch an infection from any spreader</i>.<br>
The SIR model postulates that, at any time,<br>
the rate of new infections is product of susceptible population s(t)<br>
<code>times</code> infected population i(t) <code>times</code> time-dependent factor r(t).<br>
Further, recovery rate d(r)/dt is some constant rate times the infected population<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_modelling_of_infectious_disease#The_SIR_model">
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_modelling_of_infectious_disease#The_SIR_model</a><br>
<br>
It is, IMO, silly to suppose that:<br>
* someone who just caught a disease is equally likely to "recover" at any time, and<br>
* infection rate for a given virus should appreciably change over time.<br>
<br>
Seemingly more credible:<br>
* some average period of time that folks are contagious, and<br>
* some probability that contagion occurs.<br>
<br>
Here are gnuplots based on my assumptions of:<br>
* 20 days average contagion, and<br>
* 1.5% or 2.5% probability of contagion during that period,<br>
* starting with a single carrier:<br>

<img src="https://sites.google.com/site/blekenbleu/Home/SRC2.5.gif"><br clear=all>
Behavior drives contagion risk, as may perhaps weather/season..<br>
Something approximating "herd immunity" obtains<br>
after about double the peak interval.   Of course, if risky behavior increases,<br>
subsequent peaks are possible, with correspondingly higher herd immunity rates.<br>
This all supposes that non-trivial immunity actually occurs...<br>
<br>
While that roughly 20% peak contagious population seems scary,<br>
20% may not be all that far off what is happening with asymptomatic COVID-19...<br>
<br>
<a href="SIR.p">Here</a> is (fairly readable) gnuplot source.

<b>SC model</b><br>
Rather than merely speculate, I hacked the gnuplot SRC model<br>
to approximate South Carolina statistics according to Washington Post:<br>
<img src="https://sites.google.com/site/blekenbleu/Home/WaPostSC.gif"><br clear=all>
...and predicted politics according to me.<br>
<br>
In the next graph, <b>C</b> represents the model's contagious population percentage,<br>
<b>R</b> represents recovered (no longer susceptible) and <b>S</b> represents remaining susceptible.<br>
<img src="https://sites.google.com/site/blekenbleu/Home/SC50.gif"><br clear=all>
Day 30 on the model graph corresponds to April 9, which was the peak day (so far)<br>
on the Washington Post graph.  The model switches from 1% to 2% contagion<br>
on day 41 (April 20), corresponding to SC governor reopening many businesses,<br>
noted reduction in mask wearing and increased traffic.<br>
* After a 7 day delay for new cases to get serious, publish cases spike.<br>
   In real life, spikes will spread with some getting sicker sooner or later..<br>
* Supposing resumed stay at home around April 30, that spike should relent,<br>
   delayed by another week or so.<br>
<br>
   The same model is plotted here for 300 days:<br>
<img src="https://sites.google.com/site/blekenbleu/Home/SC300.gif"><br clear=all>
Supposing the governor again reopens business around May 15,<br>
another, lower, spike provokes no reclosing.  By this time,<br>
the population percentage still susceptible will have been reduced so that<br>
resumption of more riskier behavior may not overtax the healthcare system...<br>

<dd><b>Re: Covid-19 Rt, "the effective reproduction number"</b><br>
<a href="http://systrom.com/blog/the-metric-we-need-to-manage-covid-19/">Here</a> is a blog post discussing their approach to <a href="https://rt.live/">estimating Rt</a>.<br>
My specific interest was how they estimate contagious populations,<br>
for which they reportedly use previous 7 days' positive tests.<br>
Since folks may be contagious for longer, this should overstate Rt.<br>
However, since positive test results understate actual infections,<br>
I consider their 7 day approximation as a fudge factor that was tuned<br>
to match their model to reported data.   Consequently, one could<br>
expect different fudge factors to better fit different populations at different times,<br>
depending on [mis]behaviors.<br>
<br>
Again, since their Rt proxy is effectively based on hospitalizations,<br>
it lags real active Rt by over a week.<br>
Since we have already seen positive test reported values double in under 2 days,<br>
a locality wants their rate before relaxing mitigations to be<br>
less than 10% of whatever is considered a tolerable rate,<br>
which might arguably be based on excess mortality..<br>
<br>
About half way down this blog post, Mr. Systrom ranks rates per state<br>
by median, then worst-case estimated values.<br>
This latter clusters states with fewest tests and least mitigations.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, while that makes LA appear to be in relatively good shape,<br>
I fear that it instead reflects recent testing biased towards folks with influence<br>
more that folks with symptoms.  Indeed, Louisiana's death rate remains relatively high:<br>

Positivity Rate<br>
According to Tracking Project figures,<br>
nearly 20% of people in the U.S. tested have been positive for the coronavirus,<br>

testing largely limited to those symptomatic and/or known to have been exposed.<br>
If the outbreak were indeed under control,<br>
then more testing should yield a smaller proportion of positives.<br>
So far, that hasn't happened.<br>
Virtually the only wealthy country with a larger positivity rate than the U.S. is the U.K.,<br>
 where more than 30% of tests have been positive.<br>

<b>excess mortality</b><br>
 I wrote an email to our U.S. Congressman, suggesting that a total death rate should be tracked<br>
in comparison to that seasonal per capita rate e.g. averaged over the previous 5 years.<br>
This might address the problem of population testing insufficient for statistical significance,<br>
with residents dying without having been tested<br>
and sick folks electing to forgo hospitals and testing, given a lack of effective treatments.<br>
<br>
While excess mortality probably lags COVID-19 infections by over a month,<br>
it might at least help identify communities that may otherwise not get appropriate attention and assistance:<br>
NY appears exceptional by explicitly tracking deaths not specifically diagnosed as COVID-19.<br>

<br>
The present mobility reduction has presumably also reduced flu infections and deaths.<br>
In some localities, e.g. where influenza rarely spreads, overall death rates may be<br>
lower than normal because of reduced motor vehicle usage and accidents.<br>
In a few places, deaths may have increased either by random bad luck<br>
or risky behavior such as driving faster because of less traffic on dangerous roads<br>
leading to disproportionally more fatal accidents.<br>
<br>
If there are localities that report decreased total mortality rates,<br>
mobility restrictions arguably somehow could be loosened,<br>

and compares that difference to Mar 29 total.  Except for WA, that reduces totals by < 10%.<br>

While not all active cases are hospitalized,<br>
scaling to better approximate states' healthcare stress now uses<br>
available beds (from <a href="https://covid19.healthdata.org">https://covid19.healthdata.org</a>) rather than population.<br>
CT and NJ should soon be getting as much attention as NJ.<br>
For the 4 states with most active cases per hospital bed,<br>
their rates of reported case increases over the last week<br>
are negatively correlated to their active case loads,<br>
which could mean that distancing is beginning to work for them<br>
or they are too stressed to fully report.<br>

It is encouraging that 2 highest increased residence rates have lowest CIVID growth rates.<br>
Missouri is worrying, but perhaps reflects better test reporting now than earlier.<br>
This also does not capture how risky is typical behavior away from home...

<br><hr>
&gt; Why case counts are meaningless without information about testing coverage:<br>
&gt; <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/coronavirus-case-counts-are-meaningless/">https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/coronavirus-case-counts-are-meaningless/</a><br>
&gt; e.g. why West Virginia was the last state to get a case...<br>

I should have also tabulated states' percentage of population tested,<br>
but even then would not know how much bias/credibility for<br>
establishing error bars...<br>
As time goes on, many of the same critical workers may be retested,<br>
which is not being delineated.

Most HEPA vacuum bags are made with fiberglass,
which can be an irritant.<br>
Enclosing them in cotton cloth envelopes addresses that.<br>

<dd><b>SC Covid-19 severity by age</b><br>
South Carolina received a federal disaster declaration for COVID-19 on Mar 28.<br>
With a population of over 5.2 million,<br> South Carolina reports testing 3,675 or 0.07%,<br>
with 18% positive and most negative tests presumably among health workers.<br>
Given general population testing effectively limited to those with serious symptoms,<br>
this may be a good population for estimating how serious are symptoms among
and between age groups.<br>  For example, the percentage of positive tests
among those 40-50 is roughly the same as their percentage of SC population.<br>
Folks 60-70 appear 73% more likely than them to have severe symptoms
while children 10-20 are only 30% as likely.<pre>
