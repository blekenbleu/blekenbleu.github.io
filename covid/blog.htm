<dd><b>COVID growth stress</b>
Positive tests updated to Apr 5<br>
and X axis changed to percent of state population,<br>
which is probably a better approximation of stress on states' healthcare resources:<br>

States want to avoid being in the upper right quadrant.<br>
PA and NJ seem vulnerable, then FL and MI.<br>
Washington state is doing relatively well by less than doubling.<br>
This supposes that state data are comparable,<br>
despite e.g. NY having tested over 3x more of its population than others.<br>

It is encouraging that 2 highest increased residence rates have lowest CIVID growth rates.<br>
Missouri is worrying, but perhaps reflects better test reporting now than earlier.<br>
This also does not capture how risky is typical behavior away from home...

<br><hr>
&gt; Why case counts are meaningless without information about testing coverage:<br>
&gt; <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/coronavirus-case-counts-are-meaningless/">https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/coronavirus-case-counts-are-meaningless/</a><br>
&gt; e.g. why West Virginia was the last state to get a case...<br>

I should have also tabulated states' percent of population tested,<br>
but even then would not know how much bias/credibility for<br>
establishing error bars...<br>
As time goes on, many of the same critical workers may be retested,<br>
which is not being delineated.

<dd><b>DIY masks using HEPA vacuum cleaner bags</b><br>
I ordered upright vacuum HEPA bags from eBay for <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&ik=0dbd7bcf46&attid=0.1&permmsgid=msg-a:r7338624276689187221&th=1714135f815b7ffa&view=att&disp=inline&realattid=f_k8khmlmh0">this pattern</a>
<br>
Most HEPA vacuum bags are made with fiberglass,
which can be an irritant.<br>
Enclosing them in cotton cloth envelopes addresses that.

<br>Excellent!<br>
&gt; I hope people will pay attention and actually start doing their part.<br>
Sadly, that's NOT happening here in Sun City;<br>
  oldsters vehicular traffic is about as heavy as before SC disaster
declaration.<br>
Significant influx of Ohio, New Jersey, etc relatives around the neighborhood.<br>
.01% KY (same as Texas) vs .02% SC, .017% VA positive.<br>
<br>
With NY .39% positive, we have a ways to go...<br>

<dd>13 have died from COVID-19 in SC since Mar 22.<br>
If 1% die, then SC may have had 1300 cases a month ago.<br>
SC reports 774 cases today, compared with 195 a week ago.<br>
Given 4x growth per week, SC may now have about 200,000 cases.

<dd><b>SC Covid-19 severity by age</b><br>
South Carolina received a federal disaster declaration for COVID-19 on Mar 28.
With a population of over 5.2 million, South Carolina reports testing 3,675 or 0.07%,
with 18% positive and most negative tests presumably among health workers.
Given general population testing effectively limited to those with serious symptoms,
this may be a good population for estimating how serious are symptoms among
and between age groups.  For example, the percentage of positive tests
among those 40-50 is roughly the same as their percentage of SC population.
Folks 60-70 appear 73% more likely than them to have severe symptoms
while children 10-20 are only 30% as likely. <pre>
