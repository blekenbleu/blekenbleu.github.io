One issue with using excess mortality to manage epidemics:<br>
too many places report deaths with no urgency;<br>
the worst may be over long before those reports are available.<br>
CDC most recent mortality data is for 18 months ago.

While studying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)">R</a>,<br>
I discovered a better COVID-19 data source, so this plot shows<br>
% increase over the most recent 3 days and approximate active cases,<br>
based on confirmed cases for most recent 20 days.<br>
That should probably be multiplied by 6-7 for estimating actual infections.<br>
One hopes that Seneca NY, Barren KY and Rappahannock VA
 recently increased testing.<br>

It is a long read;  to summarize:<br>
without an app based on Google/Apple smartphone tracing,<br>
this pandemic continues until immunity, which requires either:<br>
* vaccine[s], or<br>
* a majority having contracted it and, lacking effective treatments:<br>
   - deaths of most vulnerable 1-2 million US residents, which is<br>
      ~ 2/3 of annual deaths from all causes.<br>

&gt; If you are to summarize all of your research<br>
&gt; do you think this boils down to a much worse second wave?
<br>
I watch daily briefings by NY Gov Cuomo, who points out<br>
that depends on how folks behave.  Just as with the first wave,<br>
localities will experience it at different times and strengths.<br>
<br>
I >>SUSPECT<< that, in much of the country,<br>
even if/when states implement tracing,<br>
many of those contacted and directed to isolate will NOT.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, if Trump prevails in forcing meat packers to reopen,<br>
a second wave in those communities will overwhelm their health systems<br>
and undertakers.  On the other hand, they will develop herd immunities...<br>
<br>
I expect a second wave here, starting around May 15,<br>
as vacationers pile into Hilton Head.<br>
With summer tourists continually arriving and leaving,<br>
appreciable herd immunity may not evolve.<br>
<br>
Since it is to me unclear whether/how much infection was spread in schools,<br>
I expect a second wave in some states to not wait for Fall<br>
and be indistinguishable from a prolonged first wave.<br>
<br>
My model suggests that 20% herd immunity may dampen a second wave,<br>
provided that infected populations are sufficiently depleted,<br>
which requires about 3 weeks of very few new cases.<br>
<br>
Refining my model wants more data and better visualizations;<br>
I am studying R and specifically tidyverse:<br>
https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html#prerequisites<br>
<br>
I suspect that Gov. Cuomo's 70% hospital occupancy threshold<br>
will prove to be sadly optimistic, given approx 10 day delays<br>
between infections and hospitalizations.  On the other hand,<br>
he may fear losing control by holding out for safer thresholds.

IMO, most recent 1 week would be more useful than 4 weeks..   Per-capita increases:<br>
.08% for Bluffton, SC;  .06% for Auburn, NY,  .04% for Lexington, KY; <br>
.13% for Louisville;  .08% for San Francisco;  .07% for San Diego,  .14% for NYC<br>
.13% & .43% for Boulder & Greeley CO;  .02% for Longview, WA; <br>
.08% for Austin, TX;  .18% & .05% for St Louis & Jefferson City, MO<br>
<br>
Use Yale's cumulative density as a proxy for partial herd immunity:<br>
<a href="https://covid.yale.edu/innovation/mapping/case-maps/population-density/">https://covid.yale.edu/innovation/mapping/case-maps/population-density/</a><br>
Johns Hopkins has a similar cumulative map:<br>
<a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/us-map">https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/us-map</a><br>
<br>
For example, 11% confirmed cases in Weld, CO implies significant herd immunity developing,<br>
which my model suggests could begin slowing growth within a month. <br>
Weld has intensive testing; actual/confirmed is probably lower there than elsewhere.<br>
At 0.2%, Kershaw has highest cumulative cases in SC; <br>
6.5:1 actual to confirmed yields only 1.3%,  a long way from reducing growth. <br>
NYC reports 3.5% confirmed;  antibody survey reported 21% (so 6:1);<br>
 partial herd immunity may be helping.<br>

Note that graph is NOT new cases, and Mark shifted plots to match 4.5% tangents.<br>
It sort of suggests that it takes 20-30 days for recoveries to start
reducing case growth,<br>
then 10 days or so for increasing partial herd immunity to begin
reducing new case rate.<br>
<br>
Partial herd immunity may kick in so promptly because of
self-selection among most risky.<br>

My primitive model suggests that, if NYC can get their hospitalization rate down,<br>
 then (supposing acquired immunity)  NYC's 20% reduction in susceptibility<br>
(AKA partial herd immunity) may make reopening there not much more risky than upstate,<br>
where contagion risk is lower, but over 96% remain susceptible.<br>

<dd><b>r[t], SIR model versus my SRC model</b><br>
I am no doctor, but then doctors are not engineers..<br>
<br>
r[0] supposes that, given a population with no resistance at time t=0,<br>
there is a meaningful ratio for<br>
how many others will catch an infection from any spreader.<br>
The SIR model postulates that, at any time,<br>
the rate of new infections is product of susceptible population s(t)<br>
times infected population i(t) and  r(t).<br>
Further, recovery rate d(r)/dt is some constant rate times the infected population<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_modelling_of_infectious_disease#The_SIR_model">
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_modelling_of_infectious_disease#The_SIR_model</a><br>
<br>
It is, IMO, silly to suppose that:<br>
* someone who just caught a disease is equally likely to "recover" at any time, and<br>
* infection rate for a given virus should appreciably change over time.<br>
<br>
Seemingly more credible:<br>
* some average period of time that folks are contagious, and <br>
* some probability that contagion occurs.<br>
<br>
Here are gnuplots based on my assumptions of:<br>
* 20 days average contagion, and<br>
* 1.5% or 2.5% probability of contagion during that period,<br>
* starting with a single carrier:<br>

Behavior drives contagion risk, as may perhaps weather/season..<br>
Something approximating "herd immunity" obtains<br>
after about double the peak interval.   Of course, if risky behavior increases,<br>
subsequent peaks are possible, with correspondingly higher herd immunity rates.<br>
This all supposes that non-trivial immunity actually occurs...<br>
<br>
While that roughly 20% peak contagious population seems scary,<br>
20% may not be all that far off what is happening with asymptomatic COVID-19...<br>

...and predicted politics according to me.<br>
<br>
In the next graph, "C" represents the model's contagious population percentage,<br>
"R" represents recovered (no longer susceptible) and S represents remaining susceptible.<br>
<img src="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&ik=0dbd7bcf46&attid=0.0.2&permmsgid=msg-a:r4000733257411381849&th=171a357b8ec0af43&view=fimg&sz=s0-l75-ft&attbid=ANGjdJ_CccwgNtT2A-ieXkAj8PuVOFKNrJPDsjioZJWgoo9nA15k9YJnUxLz3xgiSxu28nsnbLatbmDKXQu5ejXUgxh5nmQX0Hza4rpQRDdVqK08loAztNlO1HLa7NU&disp=emb&realattid=ii_k9bomvpq1"><br clear=all>
Day 30 on the model graph corresponds to April 9, which was the peak day (so far)<br>
on the Washington Post graph.  The model switches from 1% to 2% contagion<br>
on day 41 (April 20), corresponding to SC governor reopening many businesses,<br>
noted reduction in mask wearing and increased traffic. <br>
* After a 7 day delay for new cases to get serious, publish cases spike.<br>
   In real life, spikes will spread with some getting sicker sooner or later..<br>
* Supposing resumed stay at home around April 30, that spike should relent,<br>
   delayed by another week or so.<br>
<br>
   The same model is plotted here for 300 days:<br>
<img src="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&ik=0dbd7bcf46&attid=0.0.3&permmsgid=msg-a:r4000733257411381849&th=171a357b8ec0af43&view=fimg&sz=s0-l75-ft&attbid=ANGjdJ8SSvMQfdr-UAmsmBWRN-Hp9NkbPKsJww9e5wVvj5vVIbCzBGyLeZwG1pOXEkj6-FyTQ4GYjIRpJR0LWqHOfXRWdMdolJIKsg79MnLQGeu8SMBGPTIeo4fDgyY&disp=emb&realattid=ii_k9box9uz2"><br clear=all>
Supposing the governor again reopens business around May 15,<br>
another, lower, spike provokes no reclosing.  By this time,<br>
the population percentage still susceptible will have been reduced so that<br>
resumption of more riskier behavior may not overtax the healthcare system...<br>

<dd><b>Re: Covid-19 Rt, "the effective reproduction number"</b><br>
<a href="http://systrom.com/blog/the-metric-we-need-to-manage-covid-19/">Here</a> is a blog post discussing their approach to <a href="https://rt.live/">estimating Rt</a>.<br>
My specific interest was how they estimate contagious populations,<br>
for which they reportedly use previous 7 days' positive tests.<br>
Since folks may be contagious for longer, this should overstate Rt.<br>
However, since positive test results understate actual infections,<br>
I consider their 7 day approximation as a fudge factor that was tuned<br>
to match their model to reported data.   Consequently, one could<br>
expect different fudge factors to better fit different populations at different times,<br>
depending on [mis]behaviors.<br>
<br>
Again, since their Rt proxy is effectively based on hospitalizations,<br>
it lags real active Rt by over a week.<br>
Since we have already seen positive test reported values double in under 2 days,<br>
a locality wants their rate before relaxing mitigations to be<br>
less than 10% of whatever is considered a tolerable rate,<br>
which might arguably be based on excess mortality..<br>
<br>
About half way down this blog post, Mr. Systrom ranks rates per state<br>
by median, then worst-case estimated values.<br>
This latter clusters states with fewest tests and least mitigations.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, while that makes LA appear to be in relatively good shape,<br>
I fear that it instead reflects recent testing biased towards folks with influence<br>
more that folks with symptoms.  Indeed, Louisiana's death rate remains relatively high:<br>

Positivity Rate<br>
According to Tracking Project figures,<br>
nearly 20% of people in the U.S. tested have been positive for the coronavirus,<br>
but actual prevalence in general population is presumably lower, thanks to<br>
testing largely limited to those symptomatic and/or known to have been exposed.<br>
If the outbreak were indeed under control,<br>
then more testing should yield a smaller proportion of positives.<br>
So far, that hasn’t happened.<br>
Virtually the only wealthy country with a larger positivity rate than the U.S. is the U.K.,<br>
 where more than 30% of tests have been positive.<br>
<br>
Hawaii has tested twice as many people per capita as Illinois,<br>

<b>excess mortality</b><br>
 I wrote an email to our US Congressman, suggesting that a total death rate should be tracked<br>
in comparison to that seasonal per capita rate e.g. averaged over the previous 5 years. <br>
This might address the problem of population testing insufficient for statistical significance,<br>
with residents dying without having been tested<br>
and sick folks electing to forgo hospitals and testing, given a lack of effective treatments.<br>
<br>
While excess mortality probably lags COVID-19 infections by over a month,<br>
it might at least help identify communities that may otherwise not get appropriate attention and assistance:<br>
NY appears exceptional by explicitly tracking deaths not specifically diagnosed as COVID-19.<br>

 lacking explicit verification for Spanish flu.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu</a><br>
<br>
The present mobility reduction has presumably also reduced flu infections and deaths.<br>
In some localities, e.g. where influenza rarely spreads, overall death rates may be <br>
lower than normal because of reduced motor vehicle usage and accidents.<br>
In a few places, deaths may have increased either by random bad luck<br>
or risky behavior such as driving faster because of less traffic on dangerous roads<br>
leading to disproportionally more fatal accidents.<br>
<br>
If there are localities that report decreased total mortality rates,<br>
mobility restrictions arguably somehow could be loosened,<br>
although that could provoke migration from places with more restrictions and disease.<br>

AZ is behaving, CT is doomed and GA will pay for their governor's foolishness.<br><br>
Since any sick folks that we personally know are not included,<br>
a second chart plots percent testing growth vs percent of population,<br>
keeping in mind that many tests are duplicates for critical workers.<br>

COVID data from states with tests < 1% of population are IMO suspect.<br>
NC is flying blind.  CA  is waiting for results from nearly half its tests.<br>
Only 4 states report positive COVID for more than 1/1000: NY, NJ, MI, WA.<br>
Other states may have less COVID or insufficient testing.<br>
MI is interesting; after bad-mouthing its governor,<br>
someone presumably pointed out to Trump that he would need their votes.  <br>
<br>
Since <a href="https://covidtracking.com">https://covidtracking.com</a> reports cumulative totals,<br>
a third plot subtracts Mar 22 totals from April 7 totals,<br>
(supposing most reported cases remain active for about another 2 weeks)<br>
and compares that difference to Mar 29 total.  Except for WA, that reduces totals by < 10%.<br>

While not all active cases are hospitalized,<br>
scaling to better approximate states' healthcare stress now uses<br>
available beds (from <a href="https://covid19.healthdata.org">https://covid19.healthdata.org</a>) rather than population.<br>
CT and NJ should soon be getting as much attention as NJ.<br>
For the 4 states with most active cases per hospital bed,<br>
their rates of reported case increases over the last week<br>
are negatively correlated to their active case loads,<br>
which could mean that distancing is beginning to work for them<br>
or they are too stressed to fully report.<br>

PA and NJ seem vulnerable, then FL and MI.<br>
Washington state is doing relatively well by less than doubling.<br>

It is encouraging that 2 highest increased residence rates have lowest CIVID growth rates.<br>
Missouri is worrying, but perhaps reflects better test reporting now than earlier.<br>
This also does not capture how risky is typical behavior away from home...

&gt; Why case counts are meaningless without information about testing coverage:<br>
&gt; <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/coronavirus-case-counts-are-meaningless/">https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/coronavirus-case-counts-are-meaningless/</a><br>
&gt; e.g. why West Virginia was the last state to get a case...<br>

I should have also tabulated states' percent of population tested,<br>
but even then would not know how much bias/credibility for<br>
establishing error bars...<br>
As time goes on, many of the same critical workers may be retested,<br>
which is not being delineated.

Most HEPA vacuum bags are made with fiberglass,

Enclosing them in cotton cloth envelopes addresses that.

South Carolina received a federal disaster declaration for COVID-19 on Mar 28.<br>
With a population of over 5.2 million,<br> South Carolina reports testing 3,675 or 0.07%,<br>
with 18% positive and most negative tests presumably among health workers.<br>
Given general population testing effectively limited to those with serious symptoms,<br>
this may be a good population for estimating how serious are symptoms among
and between age groups.<br>  For example, the percentage of positive tests
among those 40-50 is roughly the same as their percentage of SC population.<br>
Folks 60-70 appear 73% more likely than them to have severe symptoms
while children 10-20 are only 30% as likely. <pre>
