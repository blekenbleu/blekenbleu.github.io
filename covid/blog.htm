One issue with <b><i>using excess mortality to manage epidemics</i></b>:<br>
too many places report deaths with no urgency;<br>
the worst may be over long before those reports are available.<br>
CDC most recent mortality data is for 18 months ago.

Darker red for e.g. Colleton than Washington, DC means that,<br>
while DC may have more new cases per 100K over the most recent 3 days,<br>
that rate is <i>lower</i> than for their previous 3 days (orange)<br>
while Colleton experienced <i>an increased</i> case rate.<br>
Places like NYC now approach 3% gray, and random testing suggests that<br>
many places have about 6 times as many folks with antibodies as confirmed cases,<br>
so New York may be approaching 20% "herd immunity".<br>
<a href="#MODEL">My simple computer simulation</a> suggests that<br>
 infection rates tend to begin "naturally" decreasing above 20% immunity...<br>

Sofosbuvir as a potential alternative SARS-CoV-2 treatment<br>
The most highly conserved protein in all known RNA viruses is the viral monomeric RdRp.<br>
Several drugs that bind to the RdRp active site are approved to treat RNA viral diseases,<br>
 including Remdesivir, recently proven effective blocking SARS-CoV-2.<br>
Sofosbuvir (SOF) is a nucleotide analogue targeted against the HCV polymerase, NS5B.<br>
Previous work shows SOF has in vitro and/or in vivo antiviral activity against other Flaviviruses.<br>
SOF already has approval as a standard treatment and a well-known safety profile; it would be interesting to develop in vitro experiments to test its efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2<br>

What this coronavirus does to your body that makes it so deadly<br>
A coronavirus infection usually plays out one of two ways:<br>
 as a lung infection that includes some cases of what people would call the common cold,<br>
 or as an infection in the gut that causes diarrhea.<br>
COVID-19 starts out in lungs like common cold coronaviruses,<br>
but then causes havoc with the immune system.  It has many more ways<br>
than does influenza to stop cells from calling out to the immune system for help.<br>

Putting the Public Back in Public Health<br>
"Although decisions to gradually reopen societies are ultimately based on<br>
 a complex calculus of political, economic, and public health considerations, it's clear that<br>
 there is a high unmet need for better estimates of communities' burden of Covid-19<br>
 to guide such decision making. Fortunately, some mobile symptom-surveillance tools<br>
 can be used for predictive modeling to address this critical priority."<br>

"... holding officials accountable for demonstrating that orders are reasonable and necessary<br>
 - has been a robust scaffold for assessing the legality of public health orders<br>
 for more than a century, since it was announced in the seminal Supreme Court case of<br>
 Jacobson v. Massachusetts. In addition to recognizing the need to give officials flexibility<br>
 to implement forceful public health interventions, Jacobson recognized that<br>
 administrative agencies are both nimbler and more expert than legislatures.<br>
 In upending this framework, the Wisconsin court did more than<br>
 disrupt settled understandings of the law: it hobbled the state's ability to save lives."<br>

"The most straightforward explanation of the apparent famotidine activity as a COVID-19 therapy<br>
&nbsp;is that the drug acts via its antagonism or inverse-agonism of histamine signaling<br>
&nbsp;and via its arrestin biased activation - all a result of its binding to [histamine] H2.<br>
&nbsp;If true, then it is reasonable to infer that a SARS-CoV-2 infection<br>

<b>bias</b><br>
> Everybody has a bias and it clouds their judgement.<br>
<br>
My bias is pessimistic, but<br>
I agree that is important for schools to reopen and worth some risk.<br>
What I suggested to my daughter for Northern VA schools,<br>
is that they consider allowing kids capable of remote learning to do so,<br>
freeing up some space to spread out those who cannot.<br>
<br>
The other key would be aggressive tracing and quarantining of new cases.<br>
Schools and parents would have to be prepared for students to be<br>
removed from classes and isolated immediately on suspicion of infection.<br>
<br>
I doubt whether many schools could open enough windows to adequately<br>
circulate air, even if clothing to keep kids comfortable were available.<br>
Most schools could never maintain HVAC filtration adequate to filter virus.<br>
Probably a lot of teachers speaking thru masks could not be understood,<br>
but even if teachers somehow avoided catching COVID-19 from asymptomatic kids,<br>
too many of those kids will probably take the virus home and kill baby-sitting elders.<br>
<br>
Other than having also written for Breitbart and other ultra-conservative media,<br>
I know nothing about this Daniel Horowitz (not the lawyer) other than what he has written,<br>
but I question whether he actually believes even half the stuff opined under his byline.<br>
FWIW, credible journalism generally does not cite sources such as <code>Gummi Bear</code> on <i>twitter</i>.<br>
While anonymous sources can be important, substantive confirmation is wanted.<br>
<br>
Beyond that,<br>
4 Canadian infectious disease self-proclaimed "experts" are not necessarily epidemiologists;<br>
they may be expert at treating infections without competence at managing viral outbreaks.<br>
It was, after all, an OPINION piece, not research.<br>
Those Canadians did publish that 95% of COVID-19 deaths are among those over 60.<br>

Of 342 confirmed cases in Beaufort Co, 12 have died, which is about 3.5%,<br>
but while folks 20-40 have been most likely to get sick,<br>
folks in our age group are more likely to die:<br>

Without better treatments and/or vaccination[s],<br>
chances of our being able to indefinitely avoid contracting the virus
eventually approach zero.<br>
Where statistically significant antibody testing has been conducted to evaluate rates of asymptomatic to verified cases,<br>
NY had about 14% with antibodies as of Apr 23.<br>
Those take weeks to develop;  NY had about 130K reported cases around April 1,<br>
 which is about 0.67% of population, so a 20:1 ratio.  Other places have estimated 6:1.<br>
<br>
That would put our risk of dying between 0.38% and 1.3%, provided that hospitals are not overwhelmed.<br>
On the other hand, I have not seen authoratative age breakdown for antibodies vs confirmed, but I suppose<br>
that less than half those our age get infected without serious symptoms,<br>
which gets us back nearer 8% risk of dying, again supposing hospitals not overwhelmed.<br>
<br>
New York City had 4 times the normal number of deaths, keeping in mind that its hospitals were NOT overwhelmed:<br>

<b>replacing animation by color coding</b><br>
IMO, identifying locations with increasing rates of infections<br>
is as important as comparing per capita new infections, but<br>
implementing that by animation felt clumsy.<br>
While switching from Johns Hopkins to USA facts<br>
(which data seems better, but formatted differently)<br>
I also decided to instead color-code most recent 3-day case increases:<br>
* pale red means latest 3-day increase is no greater than that for previous 3 days<br>
* dark red means latest increase is greater, perhaps growing out of control:<br>
New case rate changes can in theory be deduced by comparing red to  orange,<br>
but logarithmic distortion visually confounds that.  For example,<br>
compare relative sizes of red and orange section for NYC boroughs.<br>

<b>"successful" Infection = Exposure to Virus x Time</b><br>
Anyone you spend greater than 10 minutes with face-to-face is potentially infected.<br>
Anyone sharing space with you (say an office) for an extended period is potentially infected.<br>
At least 44% of all infections--and a majority of community-acquired transmissions--occur from people without symptoms.<br>
   20% of infected people are responsible for 99% of viral loads.<br>
<br>
Biggest outbreaks are in prisons, religious ceremonies, and workplaces<br>
such a meat packing facilities and call centers. Any environment that is enclosed,<br>
with poor air circulation and high density of people, spells trouble.<br>

> Virginia's rates were never great, and most people have had a hell of a time getting approved to get tested.<br>
<br>
There are not enough tests to go around.  NY developed their own.<br>

<br>
Trump's "plan" is to keep his potential voters among employees in the
dark enough to go back to work.<br>
<br>
> So I expect an ongoing shit show for some time.<br>

<br>
> As in I fully expect "virtual" school when they start this fall because people are going to screw up so badly, and the virus is that big a problem.<br>
<br>
There is no real solution until vaccine and/or effective treatment and/or herd (what is left of it) immunity.<br>
Until then, this is mostly about the rate at which vulnerable get infected.<br>
As Fauci notes,
"The idea of having treatments available or a vaccine to facilitate
the re-entry of students into the fall term<br>
 would be something that would be a bit of a bridge too far."<br>
<br>
While most freak about exposing kids,<br>
numbers to date suggest they are less at risk than most others,<br>
and weird provisions that many workers would make instead of sending
them to school,<br>
such as baby-sitting by grandparents or unlicensed daycare, could have
worse outcomes.<br>
<br>
Perhaps a better approach is to let kids over 12 or so remote learn,<br>
then spread younger students among classrooms unused by teens.<br>
<br>
> NY is advertising free testing, no symptoms necessary to qualify on the news tonight.<br>
<br>
Great, that is presumably thanks to NY having developed their own tests.<br>
VA has sharply reduced testing, despite major growth in northern VA cases.<br>
Many spread the infection for a week before showing symptoms.<br>
NY also wants a better handle on what percentage have antibodies.<br>
<br>
Monday, VA had 989 positive results from 7562 tests, of which almost certainly most were of health workers.<br>
<br>
Similarly for SC<br>

Comparing to yesterday's graph, some places with relatively small (or no)<br>
orange may report mostly in multi-day batches.  Graphng weekly data
would smooth such results but delay showing serious increases,<br>
such nearly doubling over 3 days in Colleton,SC Bastrop,TX and Rappahannock,VA<br>
(keeping in mind logarithmic scaling, which visually deemphasizes counts from more than 20 days ago).<br>

This design intentionally portrays relative contagion risks;<br>
while e.g. Westchester NY has nearly twice as many recovered as currently contagious,<br>

It is a long read;  to summarize:<br>
without an app based on Google/Apple smartphone tracing,<br>
this pandemic continues until immunity, which requires either:<br>
* vaccine[s], or<br>
* a majority having contracted it and, lacking effective treatments:<br>
   - deaths of most vulnerable 1-2 million US residents, which is<br>

&gt; If you are to summarize all of your research<br>
&gt; do you think this boils down to a much worse second wave?
<br>
I watch daily briefings by NY Gov Cuomo, who points out<br>
that depends on how folks behave.  Just as with the first wave,<br>
localities will experience it at different times and strengths.<br>
<br>
I >>SUSPECT<< that, in much of the country,<br>
even if/when states implement tracing,<br>
many of those contacted and directed to isolate will NOT.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, if Trump prevails in forcing meat packers to reopen,<br>
a second wave in those communities will overwhelm their health systems<br>
and undertakers.  On the other hand, they will develop herd immunities...<br>
<br>
I expect a second wave here, starting around May 15,<br>
as vacationers pile into Hilton Head.<br>
With summer tourists continually arriving and leaving,<br>
appreciable herd immunity may not evolve.<br>
<br>
Since it is to me unclear whether/how much infection was spread in schools,<br>
I expect a second wave in some states to not wait for Fall<br>
and be indistinguishable from a prolonged first wave.<br>
<br>
My model suggests that 20% herd immunity may dampen a second wave,<br>
provided that infected populations are sufficiently depleted,<br>
which requires about 3 weeks of very few new cases.<br>
<br>
Refining my model wants more data and better visualizations;<br>
I am studying R and specifically tidyverse:<br>
https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html#prerequisites<br>
<br>
I suspect that Gov. Cuomo's 70% hospital occupancy threshold<br>
will prove to be sadly optimistic, given approx 10 day delays<br>
between infections and hospitalizations.  On the other hand,<br>
he may fear losing control by holding out for safer thresholds.

<img width=600 src="https://sites.google.com/site/blekenbleu/Home/NYT.png"><br clear=all>
IMO, most recent 1 week would be more useful than 4 weeks..   Per-capita increases:<br>
.08% for Bluffton, SC;  .06% for Auburn, NY,  .04% for Lexington, KY;<br>
.13% for Louisville;  .08% for San Francisco;  .07% for San Diego,  .14% for NYC<br>
.13% & .43% for Boulder & Greeley CO;  .02% for Longview, WA;<br>
.08% for Austin, TX;  .18% & .05% for St Louis & Jefferson City, MO<br>
<br>
Use Yale's cumulative density as a proxy for partial herd immunity:<br>
<a href="https://covid.yale.edu/innovation/mapping/case-maps/population-density/">https://covid.yale.edu/innovation/mapping/case-maps/population-density/</a><br>

<img width=600 src="https://sites.google.com/site/blekenbleu/Home/yale.png"><br clear=all>
<br>
For example, 11% confirmed cases in Weld, CO implies significant herd immunity developing,<br>
which my model suggests could begin slowing growth within a month.<br>
Weld has intensive testing; actual/confirmed is probably lower there than elsewhere.<br>
At 0.2%, Kershaw has highest cumulative cases in SC;<br>
6.5:1 actual to confirmed yields only 1.3%,  a long way from reducing growth.<br>
NYC reports 3.5% confirmed;  antibody survey reported 21% (so 6:1);<br>
 partial herd immunity may be helping.<br>

(AKA partial herd immunity) may make reopening there not much more risky than upstate,<br>

<dd><a name=MODEL><b>r[t], SIR model versus my SRC model</b><br></a>
I am no doctor, but then doctors are not engineers..<br>
<br>
r[0] supposes that, given a population with no resistance at time t=0,<br>
there is a meaningful ratio for<br>
<i>how many others will catch an infection from any spreader</i>.<br>
The SIR model postulates that, at any time,<br>
the rate of new infections is product of susceptible population s(t)<br>
<code>times</code> infected population i(t) <code>times</code> time-dependent factor r(t).<br>
Further, recovery rate d(r)/dt is some constant rate times the infected population<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_modelling_of_infectious_disease#The_SIR_model">
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_modelling_of_infectious_disease#The_SIR_model</a><br>
<br>
It is, IMO, silly to suppose that:<br>
* someone who just caught a disease is equally likely to "recover" at any time, and<br>
* infection rate for a given virus should appreciably change over time.<br>
<br>
Seemingly more credible:<br>
* some average period of time that folks are contagious, and<br>
* some probability that contagion occurs.<br>
<br>
Here are gnuplots based on my assumptions of:<br>
* 20 days average contagion, and<br>
* 1.5% or 2.5% probability of contagion during that period,<br>
* starting with a single carrier:<br>

Behavior drives contagion risk, as may perhaps weather/season..<br>
Something approximating "herd immunity" obtains<br>
after about double the peak interval.   Of course, if risky behavior increases,<br>
subsequent peaks are possible, with correspondingly higher herd immunity rates.<br>
This all supposes that non-trivial immunity actually occurs...<br>
<br>
While that roughly 20% peak contagious population seems scary,<br>
20% may not be all that far off what is happening with asymptomatic COVID-19...<br>
<br>
<a href="SIR.p">Here</a> is (fairly readable) gnuplot source.
<hr>
<b>SC model</b><br>
Rather than merely speculate, I hacked the gnuplot SRC model<br>
to approximate South Carolina statistics according to Washington Post:<br>
<img src="https://sites.google.com/site/blekenbleu/Home/WaPostSC.gif"><br clear=all>
...and predicted politics according to me.<br>
<br>
In the next graph, "C" represents the model's contagious population percentage,<br>
"R" represents recovered (no longer susceptible) and S represents remaining susceptible.<br>
<img src="https://sites.google.com/site/blekenbleu/Home/SC50.gif"><br clear=all>
Day 30 on the model graph corresponds to April 9, which was the peak day (so far)<br>
on the Washington Post graph.  The model switches from 1% to 2% contagion<br>
on day 41 (April 20), corresponding to SC governor reopening many businesses,<br>
noted reduction in mask wearing and increased traffic.<br>
* After a 7 day delay for new cases to get serious, publish cases spike.<br>
   In real life, spikes will spread with some getting sicker sooner or later..<br>
* Supposing resumed stay at home around April 30, that spike should relent,<br>
   delayed by another week or so.<br>
<br>
   The same model is plotted here for 300 days:<br>
<img src="https://sites.google.com/site/blekenbleu/Home/SC300.gif"><br clear=all>
Supposing the governor again reopens business around May 15,<br>
another, lower, spike provokes no reclosing.  By this time,<br>
the population percentage still susceptible will have been reduced so that<br>
resumption of more riskier behavior may not overtax the healthcare system...<br>

<dd><b>Re: Covid-19 Rt, "the effective reproduction number"</b><br>
<a href="http://systrom.com/blog/the-metric-we-need-to-manage-covid-19/">Here</a> is a blog post discussing their approach to <a href="https://rt.live/">estimating Rt</a>.<br>
My specific interest was how they estimate contagious populations,<br>
for which they reportedly use previous 7 days' positive tests.<br>
Since folks may be contagious for longer, this should overstate Rt.<br>
However, since positive test results understate actual infections,<br>
I consider their 7 day approximation as a fudge factor that was tuned<br>
to match their model to reported data.   Consequently, one could<br>
expect different fudge factors to better fit different populations at different times,<br>
depending on [mis]behaviors.<br>
<br>
Again, since their Rt proxy is effectively based on hospitalizations,<br>
it lags real active Rt by over a week.<br>
Since we have already seen positive test reported values double in under 2 days,<br>
a locality wants their rate before relaxing mitigations to be<br>
less than 10% of whatever is considered a tolerable rate,<br>
which might arguably be based on excess mortality..<br>
<br>
About half way down this blog post, Mr. Systrom ranks rates per state<br>
by median, then worst-case estimated values.<br>
This latter clusters states with fewest tests and least mitigations.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, while that makes LA appear to be in relatively good shape,<br>
I fear that it instead reflects recent testing biased towards folks with influence<br>
more that folks with symptoms.  Indeed, Louisiana's death rate remains relatively high:<br>

<b>excess mortality</b><br>

This might address the problem of population testing insufficient for statistical significance,<br>
with residents dying without having been tested<br>
and sick folks electing to forgo hospitals and testing, given a lack of effective treatments.<br>
<br>
While excess mortality probably lags COVID-19 infections by over a month,<br>
it might at least help identify communities that may otherwise not get appropriate attention and assistance:<br>

The present mobility reduction has presumably also reduced flu infections and deaths.<br>
In some localities, e.g. where influenza rarely spreads, overall death rates may be<br>
lower than normal because of reduced motor vehicle usage and accidents.<br>
In a few places, deaths may have increased either by random bad luck<br>
or risky behavior such as driving faster because of less traffic on dangerous roads<br>
leading to disproportionally more fatal accidents.<br>

If there are localities that report decreased total mortality rates,<br>

&gt; On the weird side, St Joe's hospital in Syracuse layed off workers<br>
&gt; because no one is having elective surgery and there is not enough hospitaliztions of Corona to keep them busy...<br>
&gt; Rochester is eeriely quiet (not sure if it is Strong or U of R)..<br>
<br>
KY Hospitals similarly laid off many employees unrelated to COVID-19 care.<br>

&gt; I listen to Gov Cuomo every day,<br>
&gt; and he has said for a few weeks that the death numbers will peak a week to 10 days after the peak of the hospitalizations.<br>
<br>
I have not found data for hospitalizations vs positive cases reported;<br>
my current best guess for NY is 13 day average delay from reported to deaths.<br>
3.5 weeks ago, it appears to have been around 7 days delay,<br>
then 10 days from 2 to 3 weeks ago<br>
and 12 days delay 1 week ago.<br>
Today, Cuomo reported that hospitalizations are down.<br>
I only access data for the state, which continues reporting relatively<br>
constant 10K new cases per day,<br>
so hospitalizations may be down in NYC metro area but up elsewhere...?<br>

To visualize whether/when cresting occurs in selected states,<br>
my first chart plots growth in positive tests between April 5 and 7.<br>
<img src="https://sites.google.com/site/blekenbleu/Home/ActiveGrowth.gif"><br clear=all>
AZ is behaving, CT is doomed and GA will pay for their governor's foolishness.<br><br>
Since any sick folks that we personally know are not included,<br>
a second chart plots percent testing growth vs percent of population,<br>
keeping in mind that many tests are duplicates for critical workers.<br>
<img src="https://sites.google.com/site/blekenbleu/Home/COVIDtest.gif"><br clear=all>
<br>
COVID data from states with tests < 1% of population are IMO suspect.<br>
NC is flying blind.  CA  is waiting for results from nearly half its tests.<br>
Only 4 states report positive COVID for more than 1/1000: NY, NJ, MI, WA.<br>
Other states may have less COVID or insufficient testing.<br>
MI is interesting; after bad-mouthing its governor,<br>
someone presumably pointed out to Trump that he would need their votes.<br>
<br>
Since <a href="https://covidtracking.com">https://covidtracking.com</a> reports cumulative totals,<br>
a third plot subtracts Mar 22 totals from April 7 totals,<br>
(supposing most reported cases remain active for about another 2 weeks)<br>
and compares that difference to Mar 29 total.  Except for WA, that reduces totals by < 10%.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://sites.google.com/site/blekenbleu/Home/ActiveGrowth1.gif"><br clear=all>
While not all active cases are hospitalized,<br>
scaling to better approximate states' healthcare stress now uses<br>
available beds (from <a href="https://covid19.healthdata.org">https://covid19.healthdata.org</a>) rather than population.<br>
CT and NJ should soon be getting as much attention as NJ.<br>
For the 4 states with most active cases per hospital bed,<br>
their rates of reported case increases over the last week<br>
are negatively correlated to their active case loads,<br>
which could mean that distancing is beginning to work for them<br>
or they are too stressed to fully report.<br>

It is encouraging that 2 highest increased residence rates have lowest CIVID growth rates.<br>
Missouri is worrying, but perhaps reflects better test reporting now than earlier.<br>
This also does not capture how risky is typical behavior away from home...

I should have also tabulated states' percent of population tested,<br>
but even then would not know how much bias/credibility for<br>
establishing error bars...<br>
As time goes on, many of the same critical workers may be retested,<br>
which is not being delineated.
