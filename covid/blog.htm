that rate is <i>lower</i> than for their previous 3 days (orange)<br>

Places like NYC now approach 3% gray, and random testing suggests that<br>

COVID-19 vaccines focus on its spike protein - but here's another target</a><br>
Patients actually make the most antibodies to the N protein - not the spike protein,<br>
but N protein is only found inside the virus particle, wrapped around the RNA.<br>
Therefore, N protein antibodies cannot block virus entry,<br>
will not be measured in neutralisation assays that test for this in the lab,<br>
and so have largely been overlooked.  This research revealed a new mechanism<br>
for an antibody receptor called TRIM21, which recognizes N protein antibodies<br>
that get inside cells, then shreds the associated N protein.<br>
Tiny fragments of N protein are then displayed on the surface of infected cells.<br>
T cells recognise these fragments, identify cells as infected,<br>
then kill the cell and consequently any virus.<br>

Theoretical Epidemic Laws Based on Data of COVID-19 Pandemic</a>  (26 pages)<br>
The standard growth model of epidemic evolution fails to explain intervention measures<br>
for mitigations of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.<br>
Almost  all COVID-19 evolution can be modeled by three innovative epidemic laws.<br>
Specifically, based on the world COVID-19 data, first divide an epidemic curve into 3 phases:<br>
an exponential growth phase, an exponential decay phase, and a constant endemic phase.<br>
Next, integrate the growth and the decay phases into the first epidemic law<br>
with interventions as a model parameter. This law is completely opposite to<br>
the Richards generalized logistic function in terms of intervention measures.<br>
Then, combine the first epidemic law with the endemic phase<br>
to form the second epidemic law,<br>
which makes the curve of cumulative cases increase linearly as time tends to infinity.<br>
The third epidemic law states if an epidemic is composed of multiple epidemic waves,<br>
the superposition principle applies. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superposition_principle">

COVID-19 vaccines will be much less effective at preventing death and illness in 2021<br>
if introduced into a population where the virus is raging - as is now the case in the U.S.<ul compact>
<li> At the current U.S. COVID-19 rate (about 200,000 confirmed new cases per day),<br>
 for a 95% effective vaccine distributed at the expected pace in the first 6 months,<br>
 about 10 million Americans will contract the virus, and more than 160,000 would die.<br>
<li> In an alternate universe with a 50% effective vaccine<br>
 but U.S. infections at the early September rate (about 35,000 cases),<br>
 deaths in the next 6 months would be about 60,000.</ul>

<br>
Some math:  200,000 per day works out to about 1% of U.S. population infected per month<br>
and about 4% average risk of infection over 4 months.  If a single vaccine dose is 80% effective,<br>
then 80% of 4% would avoid infection after 4 months vs 95% of 2%.  Last I knew, 3.2% > 1.9%<br>

Genetic screens identify host factors for SARS-CoV-2 and common cold coronaviruses</a> (67 pages)<br>
Some human molecules required for SARS-CoV-2 infection<br>
weren't needed by the two common cold coronaviruses, and vice versa.<br>
These findings could help explain what makes SARS-CoV-2 more deadly than the other two viruses.<br>
 Researchers found that certain genetic mutations prevented all three<br>
coronaviruses from successfully infecting and killing the cells.<br>
These were mutations in genes known to control the balance of two types of lipid molecules in human cells,<br>
namely cholesterol and phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP).<br>
To verify the importance of the cholesterol and PIP genes for coronavirus infection,<br>
researchers engineered human cells that lack these genes completely and infected them with the virus.<br>
Cells lacking the genes were protected from infection by all three coronaviruses.<br>
Similarly, when the team used existing compounds to disrupt the balance of PIP or cholesterol,<br>
the cells were less susceptible to infection by any of the viruses.<br>
"If we could develop a few broader antiviral drugs that target host cells' molecules,<br>
 that would go a long way toward making us better prepared for future pandemic viruses."<br>

Differential effects of intervention timing on COVID-19 spread in the U.S.</a> (10 pages)<br>
Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have successfully limited COVID-19 spread<br>

adapting and applying a dynamic metapopulation model informed by human mobility data<br>

The relative impact of prioritisation strategies varies greatly<br>
depending on concurrent public health interventions,<br>

have similar impacts on incremental net monetary benefit<br>
when there is no prioritisation given to any age or risk group (147 vs. 120 million, respectively),<br>
but when older and high risk groups are given priority, the benefit of school closures is<br>
much larger than reducing contacts for seniors (iNB 122 vs. 79 million, respectively).<br>

The COVID-19 vaccines are a marvel of science. Here's how we can make the best use of them</a><br>
"There's tremendous pressure to get the vaccine out and then administered in 24 hours"<br>
Some experts worry the artificial deadline could lead to a botched rollout.<br>
The Association of Immunization Managers and ASTHO (Association of State and Territorial Health Officers)<br>
have been pleading with Congress for money to do the work<br>
on the ground to get people vaccinated. They argue states need $8.4 billion to recruit<br>
and train extra workers, to run local advertising, to beef up software programs<br>
that are not currently up to the task. So far, they've received $340 million.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/12/01/health-workers-long-term-care-facilities-should-get-covid-19-vaccine-first-cdc-advisory-panel-says/">
Vaccine rollout</a><br>
Long-term care residents, who have suffered a terrible toll in the pandemic,<br>
are a more recent addition to Phase 1a, as the first group is called. As of Nov. 26,<br>
there have been 730,000 COVID-19 cases in this population, and 100,240 deaths.<br>
While COVID-19 vaccines have not yet been tested in long-term care residents,<br>
they have been tested in some older adults in clinical trials.<br>
These volunteers reported fewer side effects after vaccination,<br>
raising questions about how strong an immune response the vaccines are inducing.<br>
States need further guidance on how to sub-prioritize vaccination during Phase 1a,<br>
because there will not be sufficient supplies initially to vaccinate all health providers at once.<br>
Vaccinating all health care providers at once might not be advisable;<br>
these vaccines are "reactogenic", often inducing fatigue, sore arms, sometimes even fever.<br>
Hospitals might want to vaccinate departments or clinics in a couple of waves,<br>
so that all staff aren't dealing with these side effects at once.<br>

Research shows shedding of infectious SARS-CoV-2 begins before a person starts displaying symptoms,<br>
and peaks at or just after symptom onset</a> (usually four to six days after infection).<br>
Shedding can continue for several weeks after a person's symptoms have resolved,<br>
from up to eight days after symptom onset in hospitalised patients,<br>
to up to 70 days after diagnosis in an immunocompromised person.<br>

No hospitalisations or severe COVID-19 cases reported in participants receiving AZD1222.<br>
One dosing regimen (n=2,741) showed vaccine efficacy of 90%<br>
 when AZD1222 was given as a half dose, followed by a full dose at least one month apart.<br>
Another regimen (n=8,895) showed 62% efficacy for two full doses at least one month apart.<br>
Global trials are evaluating participants aged 18 years or over from diverse racial<br>
and geographic groups who are healthy or have stable underlying medical conditions.<br>
The vaccine uses a weakened version of a common cold virus<br>
that is combined with genetic material for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.<br>
The vaccine can be stored, transported and handled at normal refrigerated conditions<br>
(2-8 degrees Celsius/ 36-46 degrees Fahrenheit) for at least six months.<br>

A new study confirms that testing half a population weekly with inexpensive,<br>
rapid-turnaround COVID-19 tests would drive SARS-CoV-2 toward elimination within weeks<br>
In one large city scenario, widespread twice-weekly testing with a rapid but less sensitive test<br>
reduced the degree of infectiousness, R0 (R naught), by 80%.<br>
But twice-weekly testing with a more sensitive PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test,<br>
which takes up to 48 hours to return results, reduced infectiousness by only 58%.<br>
In other scenarios, when the amount of testing was the same, the rapid test<br>
always reduced infectiousness better than the slower, more sensitive PCR test,<br>
because about two-thirds of infected people have no symptoms<br>
and as they await their results, they continue to spread the virus.<br>

<b>A message from Southwest President, Tom Nealon</b><br>
&gt;&gt; Don't just take it from me!<br>
<br>
I certainly won't!!<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; we're implementing the Southwest Promise from check-in to deplaning.<br>
&gt;&gt; <a href="https://www.southwest.com/airline-cleanliness-social-distance">
https://www.southwest.com/airline-cleanliness-social-distance</a><br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; We've employed stringent cleaning and physical-distancing practices<br>
&gt;&gt; such as using electrostatic and anti-microbial spray treatments in the cabin<br>
<br>
Sanitation is nice, but nearly useless for mitigating COVID-19<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; We use HEPA (High-efficiency particulate air) onboard<br>
&gt;&gt;  that removes 99.97% of airborne particles*<br>
<br>
In theory, that should be nothing new;<br>
commercial passenger aircraft have been designed with HEPA filters for years.<br>
Hopefully, more attention is now being paid to their maintenance.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;  - similar to the technology found in hospitals.<br>
<br>
Not really;  properly designed hospital ventilation controls flows<br>
(e.g. by controlling pressure differentials between rooms and hallways)<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; exchange of cabin air every two to three minutes<br>
<br>
That is a considerably higher exchange rate than in hospitals.<br>
One problem is that folks sitting near aircraft HVAC returns<br>
are exposed to fresh saliva aerosols <i><b>before</b></i> they are filtered.<br>
A traveler should research the design of each aircraft<br>
to reserve seats as far from HVAC returns as possible.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Because many people with COVID-19 may be asymptomatic,<br>
<br>
For "many", substitute "most".<br>
That is why travel CANNOT be safe unless/until ALL passengers are required<br>
to STRICTLY quarantine for at least 10 days immediately prior to departure,<br>
then wear an N95 mask and pass a COVID-19 diagnostic test before entering terminals,<br>
spending absolutely minimal time inside terminals.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Southwest Airlines requires all travelers wear a face covering over their nose and mouth,<br>
<br>
... but not necessarily very effective masks.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; We are serving water and snacks on flights over 250 miles, when available<br>
<br>
That is where it REALLY falls apart.  Removing masks for water and snacks is doomed,<br>
and spending enough time to need refreshments in aircraft increases transmission risk,<br>
because airflow in aircraft cabins is NOT laminar; droplet densities will accumulate in eddys.<br>

On Friday, Pfizer and BioNTech submitted an EUA application to the FDA<br>
for their COVID-19 vaccine candidate, and more than 195,500 new infections were reported.<br>
The highest number of single-day cases during the country's summer surge<br>
was a little more than 77,100 in July.<br>
Colorado officials said a new modeling report estimates<br>
about one out of every 49 residents in the state is infected with COVID-19.<br>
In newly updated guidance, the CDC now says.  At least 24 hospital leaders<br>
warned the American Hospital Association they are experiencing staffing shortages<br>
in states including Texas, Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota and North and South Dakota.<br>
most COVID-19 infections are spread by people who have no symptoms.<br>

Researchers model which approaches are most effective at reducing COVID-19 spread<br>
Events were categorized as high or low transmission probability<br>
The model suggests that physical distancing was effective<br>
at reducing COVID-19 transmission in all settings<br>
but the effectiveness of social bubbles<br>
depends on whether chances of transmission are high or low.<br>
Masks and other physical barriers may be less effective in high transmission settings<br>
(parties, choirs, restaurant kitchens, crowded offices, nightclubs and bars)<br>
because even if masks halve the transmission rates<br>
that may not have much impact on the transmission probability<br>

Estimating COVID-19 Virus Prevalence from Records of Testing Rate and Test Positivity<br>
PCR testing for COVID-19 is not done at random but selectively on suspected cases.<br>
This paper presents a method to estimate a 'genuine Virus Prevalence'<br>
by quantifying and removing the bias related to selective testing.<br>
Via pairing of 'genuine Virus Prevalence' with Excess-Deaths,<br>
a 'genuine Infection Fatality Rate' (IFR) is also derived.<br>
'Genuine Virus Prevalence' curves suggest that during the 1st epidemic wave,<br>
curve flattening and waning happened at very modest levels of infection spread,<br>
either naturally or facilitated by government measures.<br>
[ This paper, based on earlier work with U.S. data, applies it to Western European data]<br>

All else equal, an optimized vaccine allocation prioritizes states with a large number<br>
of projected cases and subpopulations facing higher risks (e.g., older ones). Ultimately,<br>
the optimized vaccine allocation can reduce the death toll of the pandemic by an<br>

This paper introduces a concept called "age specific months of mortality" (MOMa),<br>
a statistic that will allow people to understand their risk of death within their age group.<br>
In a year without excess mortality, i.e. no pandemic, individual causes of death will add up<br>
 to a total of 12 MOMa. Excess mortality, e.g. a pandemic, adds MOMa beyond 12.<br>
For people in their 20s, the MOMa is 5 for accidents, 1.9 for suicide, 1.6 for homicide,<br>
and 1.2 for COVID-19.<br>
For people in their 60s, the MOMa is 12 for COVID-19, 4 for cancer, 2.6 for coronary heart,<br>
and treatment of COVID-19 with dexamethasone reduces MOMa from 12 to 7 months.<br>

How chemicals like PFAS can increase your risk of severe COVID-19<br>
Endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) are a broad group of chemicals<br>
that can interfere with natural hormones in people's bodies in ways that harm human health.<br>
They include perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, better known as PFAS,<br>
flame retardants, plasticizers, pesticides, antimicrobial products and fragrances, among others.<br>
Research has shown that people who are exposed to EDCs are more likely than others to develop metabolic disorders,<br>
such as obesity, Type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol, and they tend to have poorer cardiovascular health.<br>
EDCs can also interfere with normal immune system function, which plays a critical role in fighting off infection.<br>

incidence will continue to rise and schools will remain shuttered indefinitely.<br>

1) They opened when case rates in the community were very high,<br>
clearly higher than public health guidance recommends for safe reopening.<br>

the 14-day moving average of COVID-19 case rate in the community was 187 per 100,000 people,<br>
far above CDC's threshold for "lower risk" reopening, which is 50 per 100,000 people.<br>
2) They did not have statewide mask mandates, or masks were not routinely in use.<br>

Lock Yourself Down, Now<br>
Almost every day, America is breaking new records in confirmed COVID-19 cases;<br>
they are up 40% from just one week ago. Cases are not confined to a region or a state;<br>
the whole nation is in the midst of a terrible surge.<br>
All of this means we desperately need to flatten the curve, again,<br>
before hospitals nationwide are overrun.  Trevor Bedford, a<br>
scientist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, in Seattle,<br>
calculates that more than 2,000 deaths a day may already be baked in for early December,<br>
meaning that even if all new infections stopped today,<br>
that many people will still die per day in just a few weeks among those already infected.<br>

In about 25 days, if all goes according to schedule, the FDA's vaccine advisory committee<br>
will recommend expanding the public use of the first vaccine against the coronavirus.<br>
If the FDA authorizes expanded use of the vaccine in December,<br>
it would occur 11 months after SARS-CoV-2 was first identified<br>
- three years faster than any other vaccine has ever been developed.<br>
According to a recent analysis, 3 out of every 4 Americans<br>
would need to receive a vaccine that prevents at least 80% of infections<br>
for that vaccine to extinguish this pandemic on its own.<br>
In the past decade, the U.S. has never managed to vaccinate<br>
more than half of adults for seasonal influenza in any single year;<br>
in most years, coverage hovers around 40%.<br>

Model Calculations of Aerosol Transmission and Infection Risk of COVID-19 in Indoor Environments<br>
Aerosols from highly infective subjects can effectively transmit COVID-19 in indoor environments.<br>
This "highly infective" category represents approximately 20% of the patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.<br>
We find that "super infective" subjects, representing the top 5-10% of subjects with a positive test,<br>
plus an unknown fraction of less - but still highly infective, high aerosol-emitting subjects<br>
may cause COVID-19 clusters (>10 infections). In general, active room ventilation<br>
and the ubiquitous wearing of face masks (i.e., by all subjects) may reduce the individual infection risk<br>
by a factor of five to ten, similar to high-volume, high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtering.<br>
A particularly effective mitigation measure is the use of high-quality masks,<br>
which can drastically reduce the indoor infection risk through aerosols.<br>

has been granted CE mark certification.</a>  IgM is usually the first antibody to appear during infections;<br>
the test can be used to identify infections in individuals that exhibit no symptoms.<br>
The antibody assay is run on the company's immunoassay analyzers,<br>
including its DxI 800 high-throughput system that can process 200 samples per hour.<br>
<br>
MIT chemists have determined the molecular structure of SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein E,<br>
which forms a cation-selective channel and plays a key role in the virus's ability<br>
to replicate itself and stimulate the host cell's inflammation response.<br>
Cloning and purifying the E protein took two and half month,<br>
then they measured NMR spectra for two months, nonstop,<br>
on the highest-field NMR instrument at MIT, a 900-megahertz spectrometer,<br>
as well as on 800- and 600-megahertz spectrometers.  Two drug treatments<br>
(amantadine, used for influenza, and hexamethylene amiloride, used for high blood pressure)<br>
have been found to block the E channel entrance.<br>
However, these drugs bind only weakly to the E protein.<br>

Can a nose-full of chicken antibodies ward off coronavirus infections?</a><br>
To make the chicken antibodies, inject the spike protein into the chests of chickens.<br>
The birds mount a vigorous immune response to it,<br>
which includes laying eggs that contain antibodies against the coronavirus protein.<br>
Harvest the chicken antibodies, called immunoglobulin Y, from egg yolks<br>
and formulate the nasal drops.  "The concept, in principle, sort of makes sense"<br>
Researchers are assessing anti-IgY responses in rats.  A "challenge" study in hamsters,<br>
in which scientists would give them nasal drops and then try to infect the rodents<br>
and cause disease, has been stalled because those animals remain in short supply.<br>
Instead, a clinical safety trial is being conducted on Australians.<br>
If that trial establishes safety, reveals no obvious side effects,<br>
and doesn't find a significant response against the chicken antibody,<br>
SPARK hopes to launch an efficacy trial in the U.S..<br>
"The number of COVID-19 patients in Australia is zilch, so we have to come back here,"<br>
with discussions for such a study under way with the U.S. FDA.<br>

If the vaccine is formally deemed safe and effective or given an EUA by FDA and regulators in other countries,<br>
an ethical dilemma comes to the fore: whether to offer it to the participants in the study who received the placebo,<br>
which could compromise the trial's ability to collect more data on the durability of its immune response and safety.<br>
Other COVID-19 vaccine trials might also be compromised: Participants might drop out if they can access a 90% effective vaccine.<br>

An Explanation for Some COVID-19 Deaths May Not Be Holding Up<br>
Patients who died from COVID-19 had been discovered to generally have little or no virus.<br>
Their immune methods removed it, but in doing so, presumably went rogue,<br>
spewing out cytokines and different drivers of inflammation that fatally broke tissues and organs in a storm.<br>
The storm concept has thus far centered on one cytokine, interleukin-6, or il-6,<br>
but a generally used il-6 inhibitor, tocilizumab, is typically not useful,<br>
and il-6 levels in critically ill COVID-19 patients range from regular to barely increased.<br>

"region-to-region reproductive number"<br>
Since it is impossible to model all the details of real-world systems,<br>
identifying large-scale behaviors is necessary to determine which details matter and how.<br>
COVID-19 parameters for these large-scale behaviors include<br>
 the average size of an outbreak within a region and<br>
 the transmissibility of the outbreak among regions.<br>
These two parameters determine whether, among a collection of regions (e.g., a country),<br>
 there is exponential epidemic spread until saturation or decay until elimination.<br>

SARS-CoV-2 was non-uniformly distributed in lungs with few areas of high viral load<br>
and these were largely only associated with an increased type I interferon response.<br>
A very limited number of genes were differentially expressed between the lungs of influenza<br>
and COVID-19 patients. Specific interferon-associated genes (including IFI27) were identified<br>
as candidate novel biomarkers for COVID-19 differentiating this COVID-19 from influenza.<br>

How likely you are to become infected with coronavirus can depend on<br>
how much virus you inhale, where those particles land in your respiratory tract,<br>
and even the weather.<br>
The upper part of the throat behind the nasal passages and above the esophagus and<br>
voice box, known as the nasopharynx, is the most accessible seeding zone for the virus.<br>
Droplet sizes most likely to reach that zone were larger than expected.<br>
"Most masks would block out these droplet sizes, so wearing a mask is very useful"<br>
"The droplets being inhaled after dehydration in the external air carry a larger viral load"<br>
Typically, an inhaled viral infection requires 1,950 to 3,000 virus particles,<br>
but 300 virus particles are the estimated threshold for COVID-19 infection.<br>

<b>A nice article about Novavax and its NVX-CoV2373 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate</b></a><br>
Made by moth cells harnessed to crank out the virus' spike protein,<br>
"it's the only vaccine I've seen out of all the candidates that are further down the pipeline<br>
 that actually had no viral replication in the nasal swabs of vaccinated animals,"<br>
Oct 2019: "Good ideas. Bad management.  The company will probably die soon."<br>
Novavax has focused on making vaccines for more than 20 years<br>
but has not yet brought one to market.  It has produced a promising flu vaccine<br>
aimed at older adults, which successfully ended its phase 3 trial in March.<br>
Novavax mostly relies on contract manufacturers;<br>
manufacturing delays slowed launch of its late stage North American trial.<br>
"I think the vaccine is going to be efficacious,<br>
 but you put that 2 billion dose task in front of a small company, it's a huge uphill task."<br>
The Serum Institute of India, a veteran vaccine maker that is the world's largest,<br>
is helping Novavax expand production at the 14,000-square-meter Czech facility, plus manufacturing<br>
an additional billion doses itself, in India, for low- and middle-income countries.<br>
Gale Smith, Novavax's chief scientist, co-invented the system using moth cells<br>
to make the protein sub-unit in vast quantities.  Nita Patel and her all-female crew<br>
developed and conducted the sophisticated tests to verify the vaccine works as intended.<br>
In February, Patel's team tested more than 20 engineered variants of the protein,<br>
identifying the version most likely to elicit a protective immune response.<br>
Now, she's characterizing details of that protein,<br>
identifying the precise locations where neutralizing antibodies vigorously bind to it,<br>
and creating a test to ensure the spike is consistent from one manufacturing plant to another.<br>

Without ever specifying exactly what "attack rate" means, this 30 page report<br>
analyzed the crap out of 112 enrolled households with 291 participants in Bergen, Norway.<br>
All households already had at least one positive case.<br>
Serology identified a significantly higher number of infected members than RT-PCR.<br>
Attack rates were equally high in children (43%) and young adults (46%),<br>
but highest among household members aged =60 years (72%).<br>
The attack rate was 16% in asymptomatic household members<br>
 and 42% in RT-PCR negative household members.<br>
Older adults generally had higher antibody titres than younger adults.<br>
The risk of household transmission was higher when the index case had fever<br>
or dyspnoea during acute illness but not associated with cough.<br>

from 2,267 households:  The chance of being infected<br>
by a single SARS-CoV-2 infected household member was 17.2%, compared to 5.1% from an outsider.<br>
Household infection risk increased from 7.5% among children 5-9 to 30% for those over 65.<br>
Working-age adults (20-49 years) had the highest extra-household infection risk.<br>

<b>Problematic oversight of EUAs for lab developed tests</b></a><br>
EUA laboratory developed tests, known as LDTs, use the same basic PCR technology<br>
to identify genetic material from the coronavirus in patient swabs,<br>
but their performance can vary widely.<br>
The FDA has granted emergency authorization to more than 200 diagnostic tests,<br>

This summer, the Department of Health and Human Services<br>
directed the FDA to stop requiring emergency authorization for this segment of the testing market.<br>
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services retained oversight of the labs,<br>
but it ensures only that labs meet quality standards, not that specific tests work.<br>
The decision meant the FDA has no way to track problems with COVID-19 LDTs<br>
- including false-positive or false-negative results - or even which labs are marketing these tests.<br>

Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotech incubator LabCentral<br>
has launched a collaborative project to help test and validate quick,<br>
simple diagnostics for COVID-19 that people can use to screen themselves at home.</a><br>
In partnership with lab facility provider BioLabs, the Cambridge Consortium<br>
for Rapid COVID-19 Tests kicked off a clinical trial last month to evaluate DART,<br>
an antigen test developed by LabCentral alum E25Bio.<br>
The self-administered diagnostic, using nasal swabs or saliva samples,<br>
is designed to provide a result within 15 minutes at home without specialized equipment.<br>
The immunoassay operates similarly to a pregnancy test,<br>
with a positive or negative result shown as lines on a strip.<br>

Seven different 'disease forms' identified in mild COVID-19<br>
(1) flu-like symptoms (with fever, chills, fatigue and cough),<br>
(2) (common cold-like symptoms (with rhinitis, sneezing, dry throat and nasal congestion),<br>
(3) joint and muscle pain,<br>
(4) eye and mucosal inflammation,<br>
(5) lung problems (with pneumonia and shortness of breath),<br>
(6) gastrointestinal problems (including diarrhea, nausea and headache) and<br>

To suppress an epidemic in these states if face mask use is reduced 50%:<br>
* a (weak) vaccine that is 50% effective would require coverage of 55-94%;<br>

In contrast, if face mask usage stops completely:<br>
* a moderate vaccine requires 48-78% coverage;<br>
* a 100% effective vaccine requires 33-58% coverage;<br>
* a weak vaccine does NOT suppress the epidemic, and further major outbreaks occur.<br>

<b>A 7-hour flight has been linked to 59 coronavirus cases</b></a><br>
Thirteen of the 49 passengers onboard tested positive for the novel coronavirus,<br>
even though the flight was only 17% full.<br>

PSA:  Yahoo click-bait about Fauci and early COVID-19 vaccines not blocking viruses is BS.<br>
Indeed, Fauci "would settle for" vaccines that prevent symptoms,<br>

Saliva vs nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) testing<br>
SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 32.2% (97/300) of the individuals using the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit (Thermo Fisher).<br>
The overall concordance for saliva and NPS was 91.0% (273/300) and 94.7% (284/300), respectively.<br>
The positive percent agreement (PPA) for saliva and NPS was 81.4% (79/97) and 89.7% (87/97), respectively.<br>
Saliva detected 10 positive cases that were negative by NPS.<br>
In symptomatic and asymptomatic pediatric patients not previously diagnosed with COVID-19,<br>
the performances of saliva and NPS were comparable (PPA: 82.4% vs 85.3%).<br>
The overall PPA for adults were 83.3% and 90.7% for saliva and NPS, respectively,<br>
with saliva detecting 4 cases less than NPS. However,<br>
saliva performance in symptomatic adults was identical to NPS (PPA of 93.8%).<br>
With lower cost and self-collection capabilities,<br>
saliva can be an appropriate alternative sample choice to NPS for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in children and adults.<br>

Vermont continues managing COVID-19 well, with no related deaths in more than 2 months.</a><br>
Unlike many other Republican politicians around the country,<br>
Phil Scott has consistently told residents to take the virus seriously.<br>
"He started wearing a mask early in the pandemic<br>
 and has stood at the back of the room in many of the state's coronavirus briefings,<br>
 letting Dr. Mark Levine, Vermont's answer to Dr. Anthony Fauci, dominate proceedings,"<br>
Vermont has two strong local media organizations - VTDigger and Seven Days -<br>
that keep residents informed and that both took an intriguing step early in the pandemic:<br>
 They shut down their comments sections, to prevent misinformation from spreading.<br>

<b>Moderna completes enrollment of 30,000 vaccine trial participants</b></a><br>
Phase 3 COVE study of mRNA-1273 is being conducted in collaboration with<br>
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the NIH<br>
and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA),<br>
part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response<br>
at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.<br>
To date, more than 25,650 participants have received their second vaccination.<br>
20% are Latino and 10% are Black.<br>
The study includes more than 7,000 Americans over the age of 65<br>
and more than 5,000 Americans who are under the age of 65<br>
but have high-risk chronic diseases that put them at increased risk of severe COVID-19,<br>
such as diabetes, severe obesity and cardiac disease.<br>
These medically high-risk groups represent 42% of the total.<br>
<br>
Moderna is one of four US Phase 3 trials of coronavirus vaccines,<br>
each involving tens of thousands of participants.<br>
Moderna started its Phase 3 trial July 27, and Pfizer started its trial that evening.<br>
AstraZeneca started its US trial August 31<br>
and paused it about a week later when a participant fell ill.<br>
Johnson & Johnson started its trial September 23<br>
and paused it less than three weeks later for the same reason.<br>
Both of those pauses are still in effect.<br>

<b>White House pandemic response crippled by infighting, lethargy and Trump</b></a><br>
Doctors on the White House coronavirus task force have been sidelined by Scott Atlas,<br>
whom colleagues said they regard as ill-informed, manipulative and at times dishonest.<br>
He's a neuroradiologist with no background in infectious diseases,<br>
who has won Trump's favor while asserting that the pandemic is nearly over,<br>
that social distancing and masks don't work, and that<br>
vulnerable people should be sequestered in nursing homes<br>
while the coronavirus is allowed to spread naturally through the rest of the population.<br>
Birx, whose profile and influence has eroded considerably since Atlas's arrival,<br>
told Pence's office that she does not trust Atlas, does not believe he is giving Trump sound advice<br>
and wants him removed from the task force, the two people said.<br>
On Saturday, Atlas wrote on Twitter that masks do not work, prompting the social media site<br>
to remove the tweet for violating its safety rules for spreading misinformation.<br>

The plans were as detailed as they could be given the many things that are still unknown, e.g.:<br>
When a vaccine or vaccines will become available.<br>
Which groups will be first in line to get it and who comes next.<br>
What kind of storage and refrigerator or freezer requirements they might have.<br>

Ohio State University have developed a new lab testing procedure<br>
for detecting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 that gives results<br>
more quickly than existing assays and specifically identifies<br>
so-called "neutralizing" antibodies - those that protect by blocking infection of cells.<br>
"With many assays currently in use, we can detect antibodies,<br>
 but that doesn't tell us if they're neutralizing antibodies."<br>
Over 14% of those who had been hospitalized had no or very low levels of antibodies,<br>

<dd><b>Fauci's "grand rounds" session at Thomas Jefferson University</b><br>
He spoke for 30 minutes at noon in his familiar Brooklyn-accented rasp, via Zoom,<br>
then took questions from a panel of Jefferson faculty and students.<br>
John Zurlo, Jefferson's chief of infectious diseases, asked Fauci<br>
 why he projects that the vaccines might be 70% effective,<br>
 rather than the higher levels of protection afforded by many other inoculations.<br>
Zurlo also asked Fauci to pick a favorite among the various kinds of vaccines now in development.<br>
That drew a laugh from Fauci,  "I don't even know.<br>
 It would be foolish to predict what is going to be better."<br>
"We shouldn't be lulled into complacency that this is only an old-person disease," he said.<br>
"If you look at the general population,<br>
 about 40% of individuals have susceptibility to severe COVID disease."<br>
Fauci said that if the vaccine is 70% effective, and if some people resist taking it,<br>
 many months will elapse before society reaches herd immunity.<br>
"You're not going to have a profound degree of herd immunity for a considerable period of time,<br>
 maybe toward the end of 2021, into 2022"<br>
"It's not going to be the way it was with polio and measles, where you get a vaccine,<br>
 case closed, it's done. It's going to be public-health measures that linger for months and months."<br>

[ more on SARS-CoV-2-PLpro ]<br>
Information gleaned by the American team helped Polish chemists to develop 2 molecules<br>
that inhibit an enzyme called SARS-CoV-2-PLpro, which processes<br>
ubiquitin and ISG15 much differently than its SARS-1 counterpart.<br>
It promotes infection by sensing and processing both viral and human proteins.<br>
"It stimulates the release of proteins that are essential for the virus to replicate,<br>
 and it also inhibits molecules called cytokines and chemokines<br>
 that signal the immune system to attack the infection"<br>
The two inhibitor molecules, VIR250 and VIR251, very efficiently block SARS-CoV-2-PLpro activity,<br>
but do not cross-react with human enzymes having similar function.<br>

<dd><b>pandemic debacles: CDC vs Birx</b><br>
Birx replaced a functional, if imperfect, CDC data system<br>
- well understood by hospitals and state health departments -<br>
with an error-ridden and unreliable filter on hospital needs<br>

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) data hub for hospital capacity,<br>

now draws on data collected by TeleTracking, a for-profit company with nearly 400 employees,<br>

Those looking for good news at the outset of the third wave do have something to point to:<br>
 the lethality of the disease. Thanks to some combination of the age distribution of cases,<br>
improved treatments and better understanding of the disease,<br>
 more vigilance in protecting the country's most vulnerable,<br>
 and more widespread mask-wearing,<br>
 which can reduce the viral load of any exposure and thereby perhaps the risk of infection,<br>
 the COVID-19 fatality rate appears much lower than it was in the spring.<br>

 in August,

The U.K. genetics study did not confirm that ABO variants affect the odds of severe disease.<br>
Some studies looking directly at blood type, not genetic markers, have reported that<br>

A Sampling-Testing-Quarantine (STQ), strategy for identifying<br>
and isolating individuals with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 in order to mitigate the epidemic<br>
Studies suggest that as much as 79% of spread is through asymptomatic carriers<br>
and there could be anywhere from 3-40 times as many asymptomatic cases as symptomatic.<br>
Random selection from the general population for testing (regardless of symptoms),<br>
can identify enough asymptomatic but infectious cases to reduce and delay the epidemic.<br>
Further, this sampling helps to identify household members of infectious cases<br>
who are also more likely than others to be infected.  [ That is basically what New York did ]<br>

<dd><b>Direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 using CRISPR-Cas13a and a mobile phone</b><br>
The assay accurately detected a set of positive clinical samples in under 5 minutes,<br>
combining crRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 RNA to improve sensitivity and specificity.<br>
Unlike previous CRISPR diagnostics, it does not require pre-amplification of the viral genome.<br>
By directly detecting viral RNA without additional manipulations,<br>
the test yields quantitative RNA measurements rather than simply a positive or negative result.<br>
Combined with mobile phone-based quantification,<br>
this assay can provide rapid, low-cost, point-of-care screening.<br>

Patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms also show low levels of interferon response,<br>
suggesting that the interferon response is crucial for combatting the virus.<br>
SARS-CoV-2 proteins attack three critical cellular processes to disrupt human protein production.<br>
Some of the virus's proteins prevent mRNA from being fully spliced and properly assembled.<br>
Others plug up the ribosome so that it cannot form new proteins.<br>
Still other SARS-CoV-2 proteins interfere with the signal recognition particle and block protein transport.<br>

Handling the COVID-19 crisis: Toward an agile model-based systems approach,<br>
COVID-19 is not simply a health crisis. It is a global crisis that couples<br>
the natural system, human society, the economic system and governance,<br>
in ways we have not seen in over a century.<br>
Only by viewing it and explicitly modeling it as a system of systems<br>
can we manage the crisis in an optimal way and move society to a better place.<br>
The worst case is a situation where a lockdown is ordered late,<br>
only partially followed (with less than 80% compliance), and lifted too soon.<br>

Social distancing:  natural experiment in 130 countries<br>
After adjusting for multiple concurrent interventions and confounders,<br>
and accounting for both timing and strictness of interventions,<br>
* earlier and stricter school (-1.23 daily deaths per million, 95% CI -2.20 -0.27) and workplace<br>
 closures (-0.26, 95% CI -0.46 -0.05) were associated with lower COVID-19 mortality rates.<br>
Only controlling for strictness international travel controls, and only controlling for timing<br>
later restrictions on gatherings, were also associated with lower COVID-19 mortality.<br>
Other interventions, such as stay-at-home orders or restrictions on public transport,<br>
were not significantly associated with differences in mortality rates across countries.<br>
Findings were robust across multiple statistical approaches.<br>
Conclusions:   Focusing on compulsory, particularly school closing, not voluntary reduction of social interactions<br>
with mandated policies appears to have been the most effective strategy to mitigate early COVID-19 mortality.<br>

why bats</a>?<ul compact>
<li> As the only flying mammals, bats expand huge amounts of energy,<br>
  eventually damaging their DNA, to which they have adapted<br>
  by dampening immune responses to DNA damage, increasing tolerance to RNA viruses
<li> Bats often range over wide territories,<br>
  potentially picking up more varieties of viruses than other mammals.<br>
  In many bat species, millions of animals roost together, easing virus spread</ul>
<li> Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is lower risk than working with live viruses.<br>
 Sample are tested on a plate impregnated with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2),<br>
 the human receptor protein to which SARS-CoV-2 attaches when invading cells.<br>
 Researchers then add a solution containing the viral spike protein fragment that can bind to ACE2.<br>
 If binding takes place, an enzyme turns the solution blue and then yellow, but<br>
 samples with antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 prevent binding, blocking the colorful reaction.</ol>

Antibodies as drugs versus small molecules as drugs</a> [ in general ]<ul compact>
<li>Small drug molecules can penetrate tissue very well and be administered as pills.<br>
However, these small molecules are not highly specific, can bind to many human proteins<br>
and cause side effects.
<li> Large biological drug molecules, including naturally occurring antibodies, by contrast,<br>
 do not penetrate tissue very well.<br>
 Antibody treatments must also be administered intravenously in a doctor's office.<br>
 The advantage is that antibodies are highly specific.<br>
 They do not interfere with other human proteins and rarely cause side effects.</ul>

Ultrapotent antibody mix from recovered patients blocks COVID-19 virus attachment<br>
Researchers determined how the antibodies worked on a molecular level<br>

Besides directly preventing interactions with the host receptor,<br>
one of the two discovered antibodies locks the infection machinery in an inactive conformation,<br>
meaning it could not fuse with the host membrane on the surface of the cell.<br>
If unable to fuse, the coronavirus cannot break in and deliver its RNA to commandeer the cell.<br>

In the race for a COVID-19 vaccine, slow starters could still win out<br>
Corporate giants Sanofi and Merck, got relatively late starts developing COVID-19 vaccines,<br>
but have such deep experience developing and testing vaccine candidates<br>
and producing vaccine at commercial scale,<br>
that both could well close the gap considerably in the months ahead.<br>

The host interactome is the network map of all protein-protein interactions inside cells.<br>
Host interactomes show a limited number of high-powered hubs,<br>
where a protein has a large number of connections,<br>
and a limited number of important bottlenecks,<br>
which are sites with a large number of short paths to a node.<br>
These are key targets for pathogens as they seek to seize control,<br>
rewiring an infected cell's flow of information and causing disease.<br>
University of Alabama at Birmingham researchers have now built<br>
the lung-epithelial cell host interactome integrated with a SARS-CoV-2 interactome.<br>

Free fatty acid binding pocket in the locked structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein<br>
Using electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM)<br>
to analyse SARS-CoV-2 Spike at near atomic resolution,<br>
researchers revealed a small molecule, linoleic acid (LA),<br>
buried in a tailor-made pocket within the Spike protein.<br>
A free fatty acid, LA is indispensable for many cellular functions.<br>
The human body cannot produce LA.<br>
Instead, the body absorbs this essential molecule through diet.<br>
Intriguingly, LA plays a vital role in inflammation and immune modulation,<br>
which are both key elements of COVID-19 disease progression.<br>
"Our discovery provides the first direct link between LA,<br>
 COVID-19 pathological manifestations and the virus itself."<br>

Recombination should not be an afterthought</a><br>
Writing in September 2020, the scientific consensus is that SARS-CoV-2<br>
did not gain the ability to infect humans as the result of recombination with another virus.<br>
 In July, Boni et al.4 found that all loci of SARS-CoV-2 diverged within bat coronavirus lineages.<br>
They were able to reach what seems to be the emerging scientific consensus for three reasons.<br>
First, instead of focusing on the lineages of immediate interest,<br>
 they performed a broad phylogenetic analysis of 68 ancestral lineages.<br>
Second, they used these trees to test hypotheses about the data.<br>
Third, they explicitly searched for recombination breakpoints and directly modelled<br>
 distinct evolutionary processes, including recombination, that could explain their data.<br>
This allowed them to offer their conclusions about recombination<br>

Suppression of COVID-19 infection by isolation time control based on the SIR model<br>
and an analogy from nuclear fusion research<br>
In the SIR model, the  second term (isolation term) in the differential equation<br>
of the number of the infected is quite similar to the "helium ash particle loss term"<br>
in deuterium-tritium (D-T) nuclear fusion. Based on this analogy,<br>
we have found that isolation of the infected is not actively controlled in the SIR model.<br>
If the confirmed case can be isolated in 3~8 days by widely performed testing,<br>
this pandemic could be suppressed without awaiting vaccination.<br>
If the mild outing restriction and vaccination are taken together,<br>
the isolation control time can be longer.<br>
We consider this isolation time control might be the only solution<br>
to overcome the pandemic when vaccine is not available.<br>

important study</a>
examines 3 branches of adaptive immunity</i> ]<br>
Antigen-specific adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in acute COVID-19<br>
and associations with age and disease severity.<br>
When the body detects a novel virus, "innate" defensive cells (which broadly attack any pathogen)<br>
rally immediately and also release cytokines to alert adaptive immune cells:<br>
1) antibodies that aim to attach to and "neutralize" the virus<br>
2) killer T cells act as a backup, identifying and destroying any infected cells<br>
3) helper T cells coordinate production of antibodies, killer T cells,<br>
    and other immune responses.<br>
* Adaptive immune responses limit COVID-19 disease severity<br>
* Multiple coordinated arms of adaptive immunity control better than partial responses<br>
* CXCL10 may be a biomarker of impaired T cell responses in acute COVID-19<br>
* Aging and scarcity of naive T cells may be linked risk factors for severe COVID-19<br>
* Neutralizing antibody levels did not correlate with COVID-19 severity.<br>
* Patients with the worst cases of COVID-19 had low levels of helper and killer T cells.<br>
"It looks like T cells play a more important role than antibodies during natural infection"<br>
Blood tests may not reflect the immune responses in tissues such as the lungs,<br>
which is a key site of attack by the virus. "I don't know if monitoring the blood<br>
 is going to tell us what is going to prevent a mild case from becoming severe,"<br>
"Eliciting both antibody and T cell responses with vaccines<br>
is likely an important step to achieving efficacy against severe COVID-19," but<br>
some of the vaccine efficacy trials aren't designed to even analyze T cell levels, and<br>
training an immune system to make strong T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2<br>
ultimately may require using more parts of the virus in a vaccine than the spike protein alone.<br>

HU researchers showed that 99.7% of the SARS-CoV-2 viral culture was killed<br>
after a 30-second exposure to 222 nm UVC irradiation at 0.1 mW/cm2.<br>
A wavelength of 222 nm UVC cannot penetrate the outer, non-living layer of the human eye<br>
and skin so it won't cause harm to the living cells beneath. This makes it a safer<br>
but equally potent alternative to the more damaging 254 nm UVC germicidal lamps<br>

<dd><b>Federal judge rules PA gathering size limits unconstitutional</b><br>
U.S. District Judge William S. Stickman IV found that</br>
the Wolf administration's policy limiting indoor and outdoor gatherings and events to 25 and 250 people, respectively,</br>
<a href="https://www.inquirer.com/health/coronavirus/spl/pa-coronavirus-business-closures-gathering-limits-unconstitutional-federal-court-20200914.html">

Up Is Down:</br>
Pharmaceutical Industry Caution vs. Federal Acceleration of COVID-19 Vaccine Approval</br>
From a legal perspective,  CEO pledges to hold back on seeking marketing permission prematurely</br>
could lead to the unusual situation of the government advocating for quick approval</br>
of a medical product even as its manufacturer declines to request such approval.</br>
Then what? The FDA process is predicated on a sponsor submitting an application to the agency.</br>
But an administration that has taken an unprecedented role in influencing FDA policy on</br>
COVID-19 could encourage the agency to issue an EUA for a product that has antibody data</br>
that only seem promising, even without a formal approval request by its manufacturer.</br>
This scenario is not out of the question:</br>
in August, the Department of Health and Human Services</br>
revoked the FDA's right to perform premarket review of laboratory-developed tests,</br>
including COVID-19 diagnostics, reportedly over the FDA commissioner's objections.</br>
Could Trump use the Defense Production Act (DPA) to compel a company to produce a vaccine</br>
for which the manufacturer had not requested approval or for which approval was not granted?</br>

Oak Ridge National Laboratory probes SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins using neutron reflectometry<br>
Neutrons are capable of probing biological materials under physiological conditions without damaging them.<br>
The team first synthesized a lipid membrane that mimics the outer membrane of cells that line the surfaces inside human lungs,<br>
where this viral infection can take place.  Employing the liquids reflectometer (LIQREF) at ORNL's Spallation Neutron Source,<br>
researchers spread the lipid membrane atop a thin layer of water in an apparatus called a Langmuir trough.<br>
They then introduce the SARS-CoV-2 spike S2 subunit to these membranes<br>
to observe in detail how the S2 and lipid membranes change shape when they interact.<br>
Neutrons are sensitive to the element hydrogen, common to all biological molecules, and its isotopes.<br>
By replacing some hydrogen atoms with deuterium atoms,<br>
scientists can create contrast in their samples and selectively zero in on different structural features.<br>

unless nearly the entire population uses the DCT system and strictly follows quarantining and testing protocols.<br>
When DCT is deployed in a population with an ongoing outbreak where O(0.1%) of the population have already been infected,<br>
the gains of the DCT intervention come at the cost of requiring up to 15% of the population to be quarantined<br>
(in response to being traced) on average each day for the duration of the epidemic,<br>
even when there is sufficient testing capability to test every traced person.<br>

Policy intervention (`lockdown') and reductions in individuals' mobility are the major predictors<br>
of SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates, but in their absence<br>
lower temperatures and higher population densities are correlated with increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission.<br>
Our results show that summer weather cannot be considered a substitute for mitigation policies,<br>

in the absence of policy interventions or behavioural changes.<br>

Think of coronavirus risk like an equation. Here's a rough version of it:<br>
The danger of an act = (the transmission risk of the activity) x (the local prevalence of COVID-19) / (by your area's ability to control a new outbreak).<br>
Individuals can control only a small portion of that equation.<br>

Children who caught the coronavirus at day cares and a day camp<br>
spread it to their relatives, according to a new report.<br>
Researchers from Utah and the CDC focused on three outbreaks in Salt Lake City<br>
child care facilities between April and July. Two were child-care programs for toddlers,<br>
and the other was a camp for older kids. Their average age was about 7.<br>
The study concluded 12 children caught the coronavirus at the facilities and spread it<br>
to at least 12 of the 46 parents or siblings that they came in contact with at home.<br>
Three of the infected children had no symptoms.<br>

evolutionary genomics and computer simulation reconstruct SARS-CoV-2 spread<br>
Because the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary rate is slower than its transmission rate,<br>
many identical genomes are rapidly spreading. This genetic similarity places limitations<br>
on some inferences such as calculating the ratio of imported cases to local transmissions in a given area.<br>
The value of detecting cases early, before they have bloomed into an outbreak,<br>
cannot be overstated in a pandemic situation.<br>

Millions of antigen tests are missing from the public data. Only six states,<br>
representing 50 million people, make separate antigen-test data readily available.<br>
Those data show that a mere 215,000 antigen tests have been reported since early August,<br>
when they first appeared on state dashboards.<br>
Even if the data are taken as representative of the U.S. as a whole, and scaled accordingly,<br>
they imply that only 1.4 million antigen tests have ever been conducted<br>
- far fewer than the number of tests that companies have shipped since June,<br>

Efficient replication of SARS-CoV-2 relies on the activity of nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1),<br>
a major virulence factor shown to facilitate suppression of host gene expression<br>
through promotion of host mRNA degradation and interaction with the 40S ribosomal subunit.<br>

[ <i>as seems nearly always the case, this article avoids answering its title question</i> ]<br>
Compared with HIV, SARS-CoV-2 is changing much more slowly as it spreads.<br>
Despite its sluggish mutation rate, researchers have catalogued more than 12,000 mutations<br>
in SARS-CoV-2 genomes, but they spot mutations faster than make sense of them.<br>
The D614G mutation reportedly represents a "more transmissible form of SARS-CoV-2".<br>

Operation Warp Speed: interim report card<br>
On its site, OWS lists the development and testing of diagnostics as one of its five focus areas.<br>
In reality, OWS appears to have stayed largely on the sidelines, with the NIH taking the lead.<br>
When it comes to OWS plans to distribute vaccines when they become available,<br>
the initiative has not been forthcoming.<br>
McKesson, one of the three largest pharmaceuticals wholesalers in the U.S.,<br>
has been contracted to be a central distributor of vaccines.<br>
McKesson plays this same role in the annual distribution of influenza vaccines,<br>
but its role here has not been clearly defined.<br>

Clinical and economic value of different COVID-19 mitigation strategies on college campuses<br>
estimated by the Clinical and Economic Analysis of COVID-19 interventions (CEACOV) model:<br>
per 5000 students (1000 faculty) over 1 semester from 3,746 (164) cases with no mitigation:<br>
493 (28) with extensive social distancing (ESD) and masks<br>
151 (25) by adding routine laboratory tests among asymptomatic students and faculty<br>
No strategies without masks were cost-effective.<br>
Extensive social distancing with mandatory mask-wearing<br>
could very cost-effectively prevent 87% of COVID-19 cases on college campuses.<br>
Routine laboratory testing would prevent 96% of infections<br>
but require low cost tests to be economically attractive.<br>

Estimating COVID-19 hospital demand using a non-parametric model<br>
Standard methods, like the Kaplan-Meier estimator,<br>
require prior assumptions that are untenable given current knowledge.<br>
A nonparametric Mixture Cure Model outperformed standard approaches,<br>
providing more accurate ICU and hospital ward length-of-stay estimates.<br>
Adjusting for sex, generally overlooked in prediction models,<br>

Two types of unconventional T cells, mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) and invariant natural killer T (iNKT),<br>
were dramatically reduced in the blood of patients with severe COVID-19.<br>
However, the number of MAIT cells increased in the patients' airways, suggesting that<br>
these cells might move from the blood to the lungs to control the response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.<br>

It has been thought that a cytokine storm contributes to disease severity in patients with COVID-19.<br>
Following the measurement of several important cytokines in patients with COVID-19 and various other severe diseases,<br>
researchers at Radboud university medical center now show that COVID-19 is not characterized by a cytokine storm.<br>
"The level of cytokines was significantly less elevated in COVID-19 patients<br>
 than in patients with septic shock and ARDS. Compared to patients with septic shock without ARDS,<br>
 so without severe pulmonary disease, patients with COVID-19 also displayed markedly lower levels of IL-6 and IL-8.<br>
 The cytokine concentrations in COVID-19 patients were similar to those in IC patients with trauma or cardiac arrest,<br>
 conditions that are not noted for a cytokine storm."<br>

Broad, and frequently strong, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses<br>
were seen in the majority of convalescent COVID-19 patients,<br>
with significantly larger overall T cell responses in those who had severe compared with mild disease.<br>
However, there was a greater proportion of CD8+ T cell compared with CD4+ T cell responses in mild cases,<br>
with higher frequencies of multi-cytokine production by matrix (M)- and NP-specific CD8+ T cells.<br>

The coronavirus main protease (Mpro, also called 3CLpro) is essential for processing<br>
and maturation of the viral polyprotein, therefore recognized as an attractive drug target.<br>
A clinically approved anti-HCV drug, Boceprevir, and a pre-clinical inhibitor against feline infectious peritonitis<br>
(corona) virus (FIPV), GC376, both efficaciously inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells by targeting Mpro. Moreover,<br>
combined application of GC376 with Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue that inhibits viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp),<br>
results in sterilizing additive effect.<br>

22 experimentally determined N-glycosylation sites were evaluated<br>
to differentiate SARS-CoV-2 S-protein antigenic regions exposed to B cells<br>
from epitopes shielded by a glycan chain.  28 protruding epitopes were identified,<br>
and their accessibility was evaluated based on position and glycan shielding<br>
and categorised into three groups based on the degree of accessibility lost upon glycosylation.<br>

<dd><b>CDC warns states to prepare for early COVID-19 vaccine</b><br>
CDC's Redfield mailed governors of all 50 states to prepare for a vaccine as early as October,<br>
with health care workers and long-term facility residents among the first to receive the vaccine.<br>
Redfield requested governors to waive any regulatory barriers that would prevent McKesson<br>
from having distribution facilities operational by Nov. 1.<br>
Plan technical specifications for two candidates described as Vaccine A and Vaccine B,<br>
including requirements for shipping, mixing, storage and administration,<br>
seem to match the products developed by Pfizer and Moderna,<br>
which are the furthest along in late-stage clinical trials. On Aug. 20,<br>
Pfizer said it was "on track" for seeking government review "as early as October 2020."<br>
[ note: Moderna is still soliciting volunteers for their trial, so not many results by Nov. ]<br>

Bayesian model comparison found overwhelming evidence<br>
for heterogeneity of exposure, susceptibility, and transmission.<br>
Small variations in heterogeneity were sufficient<br>
to explain the large differences in mortality rates across countries.  A dynamic causal model<br>
that incorporates heterogeneity of exposure, susceptibility and transmission suggests that<br>
the next wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will be much smaller than conventional models predict,<br>
with less economic and health disruption. This heterogeneity means that<br>
seroprevalence underestimates effective herd immunity and, crucially,<br>
the potential of public health programmes.<br>

<a href="https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2020/08/31/most-americans-believe-the-covid-19-vaccine-approval-process-is-driven-by-politics-not-science/">
78% of Americans worry the COVID-19 vaccine approval process is being driven more by politics than science,</a><br>
according to a new survey of 2067 adults by STAT and the Harris Poll, a reflection of concern<br>
that the Trump administration may give the green light to a vaccine prematurely.<br>
<br>
By analyzing disparate pandemic strategies and results among all 3,142 U.S. counties and the District of Columbia,<br>
Duke researchers found that only the most aggressive control measures, such as stay-at-home orders and mask mandates,<br>
produced across-the-board reductions in both COVID-19 cases and deaths.  Closing businesses<br>
and limiting social gathering sizes reduced cases and deaths in some parts of the country, but not others.<br>

<br>
Seemingly one reason for reported lower COVID-19 infection rates for children<br>
is that it takes longer before their tests to report positive results.<br>

Partnership deals for COVID-19 diagnostics and therapies<br>
Diagnostic tests presently used fall largely into two groups:<br>
those that detect viral nucleic acid sequences and<br>
those that detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 produced by the immune system.<br>
Nucleic acid-based tests are simpler to develop and more accurate,<br>
but only for active infections.<br>

National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine expect 4 of 7 COVID-19 vaccines to fail<br>
"Four of the trials will fail, and all subjects in those trials are<br>
offered access to an approved vaccine," the group wrote in their draft<br>
report. "Three of the trials will succeed, and,<br>
under a 1:1 ratio between members of treatment groups compared to the<br>
placebo group,<br>
15,000 participants from each of those trials<br>
who were assigned to the placebo condition are offered an approved vaccine."<br>
Vaccines would then be distributed in four phases with health-care<br>
workers and vulnerable Americans, such as the elderly and those with<br>
underlying health conditions, getting it first.<br>
The U.S., as part of Operation Warp Speed, has already invested billions of dollars<br>
in 6 potential vaccines, including from drug companies Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca,<br>
which have entered phase 3 trials.<br>

How to use ventilation and air filtration to prevent COVID-19 indoor spread.</a><br>
Two options: (1) bring in fresh air from outside (2)remove the virus from inside air<br>
A 2016 study suggests that an exchange rate of nine times per hour<br>
reduced SARS, MERS and H1N1 spread in a Hong Kong hospital.<br>
CO2 levels outside are just above 400 parts per million (ppm).<br>
A well ventilated room will have around 800 ppm of CO2.<br>
Any higher than that is a sign the room might need more ventilation.<br>
The best virus removal option is a cleaner using a (HEPA) filter.<br>

Mako Medical Laboratories, a six-year-old diagnostic company based in Raleigh, N.C.,<br>
decided in 2020 to enter the nascent field of nutritional DNA, making suggestions<br>
to optimize customers' diet based on their genomes.  The equipment and tools used to test DNA for nutritional recommendations<br>
are also used for coronavirus testing. As other large diagnostic companies like Quest and LabCorp<br>
struggle to process an enormous number of samples for testing, Mako suddenly finds itself with capacity to spare,<br>
with 11 polymerase chain reaction testing machines and 22 machines to purify RNA, which combined<br>
are capable of processing 384 samples at a time, and 600 lab techs hired since April.<br>
Once a sample is at the company's lab outside Raleigh, it takes only 6 - 8 hours for a lab tech<br>
to purify it through RNA extraction and run it through one of the machines, which seeks<br>
to identify the presence of three genes that in combination indicate a COVID-19 infection.<br>
The company could process 25,000 to 30,000 samples a day, with turnaround less than 36 hours.<br>

COVID-19 and Seasonal Influenza: Preparing for a Collision<br>
As the country grapples with this new surge in COVID-19 cases, another potential crisis<br>
looms: flu season. Every fall and winter, seasonal influenza takes a devastating toll in the U.S.;<br>
particularly among those over the age of 65 and under the age of 5. Hospitals fill up with<br>
individuals needing respiratory support and schools serve as epicenters for community spread.<br>
The challenges of seasonal influenza alone are great, but when combined with the COVID-19<br>
pandemic, many cities and states could find the impact overwhelming.<br>

Mathematical modeling in the age of COVID-19<br>
Modeling the epidemiology, lungs and disease processes<br>
Compared with seasonal flu, coronavirus disease has a number of features:<br>
 a longer incubation period (on average about 5 days, but can reach several weeks),<br>
 higher mortality (estimated at 2-4%, although accurate estimates are not yet possible),<br>
 a large number of asymptotic cases (but possibly transmitting the infection),<br>
 a large number of cases with a severe course of the disease<br>
 and complications to other organs (mainly lungs).<br>
Models based on ordinary differential equations do not take into account<br>
a possible spatial distribution or heterogeneity of infected individuals and of other population sub-classes.<br>

yielding some encouraging results in uncontrolled observational studies,<br>

due to their non-specific (i.e. off-target) mode of action,<br>

According to researchers at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center,<br>
antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (S-RBD)<br>
are speculated to neutralize virus infection,<br>
while the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) antibody<br>
may often only indicate exposure to the virus, not protections against reinfection.<br>
3% of healthy and non-COVID-19 samples collected during Houston's pandemic<br>
were positive for the N-protein antibody, but only 1.6% of those had the S-RBD antibody.<br>
Of samples with the S-RBD antibody, 86% had neutralizing capacity<br>
 - meaning they could prevent reinfection of COVID-19,<br>
 but only 74% of samples with N-protein had neutralizing capacity.<br>
When positive for both, 96.5% exhibited neutralizing capacity.<br>

Molecular Characterization of Ebselen Binding Activity to SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease<br>
Given its essential role in proteolytic processing, the main protease Mpro has been identified<br>
as an attractive candidate for drugs against SARS-CoV-2 and similar coronaviruses.<br>
Recent high-throughput screening studies have identified existing, small-molecule drugs<br>
as potent Mpro inhibitors. Amongst these, Ebselen (2-Phenyl-1,2-benzoselenazol-3-one),<br>
a glutathione peroxidase mimetic seleno-organic compound, is particularly attractive.<br>
Recent experiments suggest that its effectiveness is higher than that of other molecules<br>
that also act at the enzyme catalytic site.<br>
Relying on extensive simulations with all-atom models, this study examined at a molecular level<br>
the potential of Ebselen to decrease Mpro catalytic activity.<br>
Results indicate that Ebselen exhibits a distinct affinity for the catalytic site cavity of Mpro.<br>
In addition, molecular models reveal a second, previously unknown binding site for Ebselen<br>
in the dimerization region localized between the II and III domains of the protein.<br>
A detailed analysis of the free energy of binding indicates that the affinity of Ebselen<br>
to this second binding site is in fact significantly larger than that to the catalytic site.<br>

<dd><b>SARS-CoV-2 herd immunity at a population-wide infection rate of ~40%</b><br>
.. by introducing age and activity heterogeneities into population models<br>
A mathematical model with proportion of infected individuals in groups<br>
with high contact rates greater than that in groups with low contact rates.<br>
One of the simplest of all epidemic models is to assume<br>
a homogeneously mixing population<br>
in which all individuals are equally susceptible<br>
and equally infectious if they become infected.<br>
Two important features known to play an important role in disease spreading were added:<br>
1) divide the herd into 6 age groups and fit contact rates derived from an empirical study<br>
2) categorize individuals into three different activity levels,<br>
&nbsp which are arbitrary and chosen for illustration purposes:<br>
&nbsp 50% of each age cohort have normal activity,<br>
&nbsp 25% have half as many contacts compared with normal activity, and<br>
&nbsp 25% have twice as many contacts as normal activity.<br>
Individuals who get infected are assumed to be initially latent for a mean of 3 days,<br>
followed by an infectious period of a mean of 4 days.  After a month,<br>
 preventive measures are implemented such that<br>
 all averages in the next-generation matrix are scaled by the same factor a < 1.<br>
These preventive measures are kept until the ongoing epidemic is nearly finished.<br>
That is, all preventive measures are relaxed thus setting a back to 1 after 3.5 months<br>
If herd immunity is not reached, then there will then be a second wave,<br>
whereas if herd immunity has been achieved, the epidemic continues to decline.<br>

Mass cytometry was used to assess immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in<br>
52 COVID-19 patients that were confirmed positive for viral RNA by PCR and<br>
62 age and gender-matched healthy controls distributed between two independent cohorts,<br>
1) the Princess Margaret Hospital at Hong Kong University,<br>
2) the Hope Clinic at Emory University in Atlanta, USA<br>
There was a striking increase in the frequency of plasmablast and effector CD8 T cells<br>
in all infected individuals in both cohorts. Of note, the kinetics of the CD8 effector T cell response<br>
was prolonged and continued to increase up to day 40 post onset of symptoms.<br>
These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a spatial dichotomy<br>
in the innate immune response, characterized by suppression of peripheral innate immunity,<br>
in the face of proinflammatory responses reported in the lung.<br>

Between 2009 and 2019, U.S. flu vaccine effectiveness ranged from 19% to 60%.<br>
Immunity from a shot in early Fall can dissipate before winter's end.<br>
B cells reside in bone marrow and make antibodies that can attach to and disable viruses,<br>
taking several days after an infection to produce high levels of antibodies<br>
- a disadvantage in influenza, which can cause disease rapidly.  Adjuvants boost vaccine<br>
effectiveness by acting as irritants, ramping up the immune response.<br>
Developed in the 1940s, the first influenza vaccines used adjuvants,<br>
but caused ulcers at injection sites and were dropped from later vaccines.<br>

Inovio boasted to Trump about its COVID-19 vaccine; <a href="https://bdnews24.com/coronavirus-pandemic/2020/08/10/this-company-boasted-to-trump-about-its-covid-19-vaccine.-experts-are-sceptical">
experts are sceptical</a><br>
In 2009, the small biotech company in PA rushed to develop an H1N1 vaccine.<br>
After announcing promising early results, Inovio's stock soared more than 1,000%.<br>
Riding the momentum, the company sold more shares to the public.&nbsp Since then,<br>
Inovio has announced encouraging news about its work on vaccines for malaria,<br>
the Zika virus and even a cancer vaccine. Upbeat declarations have caused<br>
the company's stock price to leap, enriching investors and senior executives.<br>
There's only one catch: Inovio has never actually brought a vaccine to market.<br>
While there are some early signs of promise with its COVID-19 vaccine,<br>
Inovio has released only bare-bones data from the first phase of clinical trials. It is locked in<br>
a legal battle with a key manufacturing partner which claims that Inovio stole its technology.<br>
While it claims to be part of Operation Warp Speed, Inovio is not on the list of companies<br>
selected to receive financial support to mass-produce vaccines.<br>
Shareholders have sued Inovio, claiming it has exaggerated its progress.<br>

Public health experts look at 4 metrics to determine how bad things are:<br>
the number of daily new cases, the infection rate (how likely is virus spread),<br>
the percent of tests that are positive (which should be low in states with sufficient testing),<br>
and the percent of hospital beds occupied by very sick patients.<br>

Results from a study that tracked 350 severely ill COVID-19 patients admitted to<br>
Houston Methodist's 8 hospitals from March 28 through July 6 offer evidence that<br>
transfusing critically ill COVID-19 patients with high antibody plasma early in their illness<br>

Putting the Public Back in Public Health - Surveying Symptoms of COVID-19<br>
To date, most projections of the COVID-19 burden have been based on<br>
incidence calculated from COVID-19 testing, hospitalizations, and deaths.<br>
However, such estimates are severely limited.<br>
New and cost-efficient participatory syndromic-surveillance tools have been developed<br>
that can be used in real time to rapidly address critical near-term needs.<br>
These tools work by capturing data on reported symptoms using mobile technology<br>
such as phone apps or Internet-based questionnaires, which often provide<br>
more timely signals of infectious disease transmission than more traditional sources.<br>

 electrostatic interactions at 10 nanometers. In physiological conditions,<br>
 all electrostatic interactions no longer occur at distances longer than 1 nanometer."<br>

<dd><b>COVID-19: Immune system gone astray</b><br>
Contrary to what has been generally assumed so far,<br>
a <i>severe</i> course of COVID-19 does not solely result in a strong immune reaction<br>
- rather, the immune response is caught in a continuous loop of activation and inhibition.<br>
"Here, neutrophils and monocytes are only partially activated and they do not function properly.<br>
&nbsp We find considerably more immature cells that have a rather inhibitory effect on the immune<br>
&nbsp response. The phenomenon can also be observed in other severe infections,<br>
&nbsp although the reason for this is unclear. Many indications suggest that the immune system<br>
&nbsp stands in its own way during severe courses of COVID-19. This could possibly lead to<br>
&nbsp an insufficient immune response against the corona virus,<br>
&nbsp with a simultaneous severe inflammation in the lung tissue."<br>

Credible assumptions replace missing data in COVID analysis<br>
Using a technique called "partial identification," researchers concluded that<br>
actual cumulative rates of COVID-19 infection are higher than reported rates of infection,<br>
and therefore actual infection fatality rates are lower than reported rates.<br>
They assumed that<br>
infection rate among those tested is higher than the rate among those who are not,<br>
and some persons tested were actually positive but not counted (false negatives).<br>
"The bounds you get are wide, but they are substantially tighter<br>
&nbsp compared to the bounds you obtain if you assume nothing about the missing data."<br>

The simulation was validated up to 80 days using anonymised data<br>

Nearly every country has struggled to contain the coronavirus,<br>
but <i>only one</i> affluent nation has suffered a severe, sustained outbreak<br>
<i>for more than four months</i>:  the United States.<br>
An aversion to collective action helped lead to inadequate state lockdowns<br>
and inconsistent adherence to mask wearing based on partisanship instead of public health.<br>
"If you had to summarize our approach, it's really poor federal leadership - disorganization<br>

Tiny Texas company eTrueNorth runs most of the drive-thru COVID-19 testing in the U.S.<br>
The company has brought in more than $90 million in federal contracts<br>
to help oversee more than 350 sites and pay for the tests.<br>
For eTrueNorth to sign a contract with the Department of Health and Human Services,<br>
it needed to find CLIA-certified labs that would run whatever tests they collected.<br>
Eventually, it found three: HealthQuest Esoterics in California,<br>
Gravity Diagnostics in Kentucky, and Reditus Laboratories near Peoria, Ill.<br>
However, the federal government's community-based testing sites account for<br>
a remarkably small proportion of the country's daily count.<br>
By July 24, about 1.1 million people had been tested over three months through the CBTS program.<br>

[ <i>much as cowpox produces smallpox immunity,<br>
&nbsp perhaps common cold coronaviruses produce COVID-19 resistance</i> ]<br>
A range of pre-existing memory CD4+ T cells are demonstrated to be cross-reactive<br>
with comparable affinity to SARS-CoV-2<br>
and common cold coronaviruses HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, or HCoV-HKU1.<br>
These finding of cross-reactive HCoV T cell specificities<br>
are stark contrast to HCoV neutralizing antibodies, which are HCoV species-specific<br>
and did not show cross-reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain.<br>

<dd><b>state officials are already confused about plans to distribute a vaccine when one exists</b><br>
With the Trump administration aiming to deliver 300 million doses of vaccine<br>
against the coronavirus as early as January, state officials and health experts say<br>
they remain in the dark about key details and, therefore, are inadequately prepared<br>
for what is expected to be the largest single vaccination campaign ever undertaken.<br>
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/08/03/coronavirus-vaccine-distribution-confusion/">
"It's probably the hardest thing they're going to do,"</a> Paul A. Offit,<br>
director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia<br>
and a member of a federal vaccine advisory group.<br>
At a recent briefing for the advisory group by Operation Warp Speed,<br>
the administration's effort to fast-track development of coronavirus countermeasures,<br>
Lt. Gen. Paul Ostrowski, who oversees logistics, said<br>
 the military would move vaccines onto trucks for distribution "the day after"<br>
 the drugs received regulatory approval from the FDA, Offit recalled.<br>
But Offit said that, based on the administration's inability to<br>
 develop a national testing strategy,<br>
 secure adequate supplies of personal protective equipment, and<br>
 deliver a consistent message about wearing face masks,<br>
the question he wanted to ask Ostrowski but didn't have the chance was basic:<br>
"Given that the administration efforts have largely been failures,<br>
 what makes you think this will work?"<br>
The administration already botched a rollout of remdesivir,<br>
one of the only approved COVID-19 treatments.<br>

typically return results at least 1 to 2 days and currently 2 weeks later in some places.<br>

Potential COVID-19antiviral drug development<br>
This review highlights recent research in the structure, function and development<br>
of antiviral drugs targeting the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 [a],<br>
which plays a key role in the receptor recognition and cell membrane fusion process,<br>
and is composed of two subunits, S1 and S2 [b-c].<br>

The S1 subunit contains a receptor-binding domain<br>
that recognizes and binds to the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [d],<br>
while the S2 subunit mediates viral cell membrane fusion<br>
by forming a six-helical bundle via the two-heptad repeat domain [e].<br>

Combining in situ measurements and computational fluid dynamics simulations,<br>
engineers quantify particles exhaled by normal respiratory behaviors<br>
and their transport under elevator, small classroom, and supermarket settings<br>
to evaluate the risk of inhaling potentially virus-containing particles.<br>
Only 10% of aerosols were filtered out in a simulation<br>

"Because this is very strong ventilation, we thought it would ventilate out a lot of aerosols.<br>
 But 10% is really a small number...  they are basically trapped in this vortex,<br>
 and it's very hard for them to reach the vent and actually go out."<br>

(which doesn't mean that being outdoors played a role, but it couldn't be ruled out).<br>
The rest were all indoor events, and many involved dozens or hundreds of people at once.<br>

Cancer is essentially a malfunctioning of cellular machinery that causes runaway cell growth.<br>
Viruses also change the function of cellular machinery, but instead of causing cell growth,<br>
machinery is repurposed to reproduce viruses, taking control over many kinases to do this.<br>
Among the better understood 97 of 518 human kinases, the virus was found to affect 49.<br>
87 existing drugs were found to change kinase-controlled pathways used by SARS-CoV-2<br>
Of 68 drugs tested, several effectively killed the virus in cells, and<br>
silmitasertib, gilteritinib, ralimetinib, apilimod and dinaciclib are either approved,<br>
in clinical testing or under preclinical development for treatment of various diseases.<br>

Georgia proves COVID-19 contagion among youths<br>
A total of 597 Georgia residents attended an overnight camp in Georgia June 17-20.<br>
Median camper age was 12 years (range = 6-19 years), and 53% (182 of 346) were female.<br>
The median age of staff members and trainees was 17 years (range = 14-59 years),<br>
and 59% (148 of 251) were female.&nbsp Test results were available for 344 (58%) attendees;<br>
among these, 260 (76%) were positive.&nbsp The overall attack rate was 44% (260 of 597),<br>
51% among those aged 6-10 years, 44% among those aged 11-17 years,<br>
and 33% among those aged 18-21 years.<br>
Attack rates increased with increasing length of time spent at the camp,<br>
with staff members having the highest attack rate (56%).&nbsp During June 21-27,<br>
occupancy of the 31 cabins averaged 15 persons per cabin (range = 1-26);<br>
median cabin attack rate was 50% (range = 22%-70%)<br>

   as well as hand sanitizing before entering the space is essential."<br>
<li> "Mechanically ventilated classrooms and offices typically have<br>
  about 20% of their air supplied from outdoors, and the rest is recirculated air...<br>
  the outdoor ventilation rate should be increased to the maximum operational capacity<br>
  of the building ventilation system, which can be two or more times of that<br>

<li> At the building level, high efficiency particulate (HEPA) filters in recirculated<br>

  and increase total clean air delivery rates (outdoor plus filtered air)<br>
  for diluting virus concentrations in ventilated spaces.<br>

Key features of this disorder include a lack of bleeding risk,<br>
only mildly low platelet counts, elevated plasma fibrinogen levels,<br>

<b>9 Things Experts Have Learned About COVID-19 So Far</b></a><br>
[ hopefully, not JUST experts... ]<br>
<br>
Using influenza surveillance networks to estimate state-specific prevalence of SARS-CoV-2<br>
Silverman et al. used data collected through an existing infrastructure<br>
for reporting influenza-like illness (ILI)<br>
to estimate the actual prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in states.<br>
Their model estimated that more than 80% of U.S. COVID-19 infections went undetected in March 2020.<br>
They identified excess ILI cases by first subtracting cases due to influenza<br>
and then subtracting the seasonal signal of non-influenza ILI.<br>
A 4-day lag between the onset of infectiousness and presentation with ILI<br>
yields a clinical rate of 25% among the 87% of simulations,<br>
which could account for the ILI surge.<br>

New evidence suggests that COVID-19 is following younger people home</a><br>
from work or social outings, then infecting older and more vulnerable household members.<br>
64 million people - about 20% of the U.S. population - lived in homes<br>
with at least 2 adult generations or grandparents and grandchildren under 25 in 2016.<br>
National security adviser Robert C. O'Brien probably caught the virus from his daughter.<br>

Masks can mitigate risk of COVID-19 'super spreaders' in rooms<br>
A severely infected person who's coughing frequently can fill a poorly ventilated room<br>
with as many as 7.4 million copies of the coronavirus for every cubic meter of air.<br>
"...individuals may be at risk of infection if they spend more than a few minutes<br>
 in a small room with a person who is infected with COVID-19..."<br>
"Swiss researchers gathered data from a handful of prior studies that tracked<br>
how much coronavirus the average infected person will emit by breathing normally,<br>
as well as the virus released by a very sick person who's coughing frequently.<br>
The team then used a mathematical model to estimate how much virus<br>
either a low- or high-emitting patient is likely to release into the air of a closed room.<br>
While engaged in activities like loud speaking or singing,<br>
viral emissions can increase by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude, the researchers said.<br>
People at rest tend to breathe in about a half a cubic meter of air every hour.<br>

[ plenty more from where coronavirus came ]<br>
Using 3 different bioinformatic approaches to identify and remove recombinant regions<br>
within the SARS-CoV-2 genome, researchers found that,<br>
although SARS-CoV-2 is genetically about 96% similar to the RaTG13 coronavirus,<br>
which was sampled from a Rhinolophus affinis horseshoe bat in 2013 in Yunnan province, China,<br>
the team found that it diverged from RaTG13 in 1969.<br>
"other viruses that are capable of infecting humans are circulating in horseshoe bats in China"<br>
"SARS-CoV-2's RBD sequence has so far only been found in a few pangolin viruses.<br>
Furthermore, the other key feature thought to be instrumental to SARS-CoV-2's ability to infect humans<br>
 - a polybasic cleavage site insertion in the Spike protein -<br>
has not yet been seen in another close bat relative of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.<br>
Yet, while it is possible that pangolins may have acted as an intermediate host<br>
 facilitating transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to humans, no evidence exists to suggest that<br>
 pangolin infection is a requirement for bat viruses to cross into humans.&nbsp Instead,<br>
 our research suggests that SARS-CoV-2 likely evolved the ability<br>
 to replicate in the upper respiratory tract of both humans and pangolins."<br>

would save between 900,000 and 2.7 million lives in the U.S.<br>

Using the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Summit supercomputer to analyze genes<br>
from cells in the lung fluid of nine COVID-19 patients compared with 40 control patients<br>
suggests that genes related to one of the body's systems responsible for lowering blood pressure<br>
- the bradykinin system - appear to be excessively "turned on"<br>
in lung fluid cells of those with the virus, allowing fluid build up in their soft tissues.<br>

<b>pandemic engineering (slow Sunday)</b><br>
Pandemic spread is driven by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fokker%E2%80%93Planck_equation">diffusion:</a>
&nbsp <img align=center src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/FokkerPlanck.gif"><br clear=all>
An essential bit about diffusion is that flux (AKA magnitude and direction of flow )<br>
is linearly proportional to density gradient of diffusing material concentration.<br>
<br>
Diffusion gets complicated by geometries and nonuniformities,<br>
so let's back off and use engineering approximations e.g. from electronics,<br>
with electrons analogous to viral particles and electrical potential analogous to particle density.<br>
One electrical property, capacitance <code>C</code>, is defined as the ratio of electron charge to potential:<br>
<code>C = Q / V or V = Q / C</code>.<br>
In this analogy, a specific human's breathing system has relatively constant capacity,<br>
and potential to diffuse viral particles is proportional to instantaneous particle concentration.<br>
<br>
Another well-known electrical law was named after Georg Ohm:<br>
<code>V = I * R</code>, where <code>I</code> is time rate of change in charge: <code>I = Q / T</code><br>
.. and R is resistance to that change.<br>
Applied to our specific human, exhaling into a vacuum,<br>
which represents practically no resistance,<br>
initial flux would be very large while particle density<br>
(along with survival odds) would quickly approach zero.<br>
Alternatively, attempting to exhale into high water pressure encounters higher resistance,<br>
although viral particles would readily diffuse into that water,<br>
provided that water initially has relatively low viral particle concentration.<br>
<br>
Electrical power (AKA energy flow) <code>P = I*V = I*I*R = V*V/R</code><br>
Perhaps unintuitively, no power is consumed even for large current flows<br>
where there is no resistance.&nbsp On the other hand,<br>
even a small potential into a smaller resistance consumes substantial power.<br>
<br>
Much of electrical engineering involves one dimensional flows,<br>
with electron flows into near ends of conductors equal those at far ends.<br>
However, antenna radiation involves 3-dimensional geometry<br>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law">inverse square law</a>
with an implicit assumption of free space,<br>
which is emphatically NOT applicable for viral transmission indoors.<br>
An inverse-square relationship arises from consideration that<br>
flow thru one surface is spread over 4 times the area of another surface with twice the diameter,<br>
with another implicit assumption that flow continues onword, uninterrupted.<br>
<br>
This distancing effect is essentially nullified in effectively closed indoor spaces,<br>
where transmission is mostly determined by duration of exposure and source flow rate.<br>
<br>
Back to antennas: given directionality, radio engineers think in terms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_radiated_power">ERP</a><br>
.. 3 feet behind a COVID-19 carrier may be safer than 6 feet in front.<br>
<br>
Back to the capacitor analogy: COVID-19 patients have relatively fixed capacities<br>
but are also relatively constant viral generators.&nbsp Consequently,<br>
larger, quiet, and inactive nose breathers may accumulate higher concentrations<br>
than smaller, noisy, active mouth breathers (AKA children).&nbsp Higher concentrations presumably<br>
promote more reinfection as well as contagion when they do speak, sneeze or sing.<br>
<br>
I speculate that one is unlikely to become sick by inhaling a single SARS-CoV-2 virus.<br>
I'll even speculate that very small doses may help develop immunity with minimal symptoms.<br>
Conversely, there may be an optimal spacing and duration for a single COVID-19 patient<br>
to most efficiently infect others, which is analogous to matching electrical impedances for maximum power flow.<br>
<br>
Motivation for writing this includes an insight that<br>
SARS-CoV-2 transmission power is probably related to the square of viral concentration,<br>
just as electrical power is proportional to the square of potential<br>
(for a constant system impedance).<br>
That nonlinear effect would help explain super-spreaders..<br>

Altered olfactory function is a common symptom of COVID-19.<br>
Single cell sequencing revealed that ACE2 is expressed in support cells,<br>
stem cells, and perivascular cells, rather than in neurons.<br>
Bulk sequencing demonstrated that CoV-2 infection of non-neuronal cell types<br>
leads to anosmia and related disturbances in odor perception in COVID-19 patients.<br>
Recovery from COVID-related anosmia often occurs over weeks,<br>
while recovery from typical post-viral anosmia<br>
- which is often caused by direct damage to olfactory sensory neurons - frequently takes months.<br>

Biologically, a COVID-19 vaccine is unlikely to offer complete protection.<br>
Logistically, manufacturers must make hundreds of millions of doses while relying, perhaps,<br>
on technology never before used in vaccines and competing for supplies such as glass vials.<br>
Then the federal government will have to allocate doses, perhaps through a patchwork of<br>
state and local health departments with no existing infrastructure for vaccinating adults at scale.<br>

Well-known anticoagulant heparin was recently shown to have<br>
exceptional binding affinity to the spike protein (S-protein) of SARS-CoV-2.<br>
A follow-on study revealed specific closely related sulfated polysaccharides<br>
bind tightly to the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, which suggests that<br>
they can act as decoys to interfere with S-protein binding to the heparan sulfate co-receptor in host tissues.<br>
Treatment using fucoidans, nebulized heparin, or possibly TriS-heparin in combination<br>
with or without current antiviral therapies, should be assessed first in human primary epithelial cells<br>
and then in human patients suffering from COVID-19.<br>

To fight infection, most coronavirus vaccine candidates train the human immune system<br>
to recognize a key protein on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus called the spike protein.<br>
University of Texas at Austin researchers designed a new version of this protein, dubbed HexaPro,<br>
that, when expressed in cells, produces up to 10 times more protein than does<br>
an earlier synthetic spike protein already used in multiple COVID-19 vaccines.<br>
HexaPro is also more stable, which should make it easier to store and transport.<br>

Wrong but Useful - What COVID-19 Epidemiologic Models Can and Cannot Tell Us<br>
COVID-19 modeling studies generally follow one of two general approaches<br>
that we will refer to here as forecasting models and mechanistic models.<br>
Although there are hybrid approaches, these two model types tend to address<br>
different questions on different time scales, and they deal differently with uncertainty.<br>
Forecasting models are often statistical in nature,<br>
fitting a line or curve to data and extrapolating from there<br>
The original versions of the controversial model<br>
from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) fell into this category<br>
Mechanistic models, like the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered frameworks,<br>
mimic the way SARS-CoV-2 spreads and can be used to forecast or simulate future transmission scenarios<br>
under various assumptions about parameters governing transmission, disease, and immunity.<br>
Unlike purely statistical models, mechanistic approaches include important feedback<br>
- the more people become infected, the faster disease spreads.<br>
In fact, many parameters associated with COVID-19 transmission are poorly understood.<br>
The resulting model uncertainty is not always calculated or reported in a standardized way.<br>

We need enough daily testing capacity to test everyone with flu-like symptoms<br>
plus anyone they have been in close contact with over the last 2 weeks<br>
(at least 10 additional tests per symptomatic person).<br>
We currently have only 35% of that testing capacity.<br>

Arrayed imaging reflectometry starts with a strong anti-reflective coating<br>
spread across the surface of a standard-shaped well plate<br>
that captures and deflects as much light as possible.<br>
Capture probes are arrayed on top to bind with a range of different target molecules.<br>
After adding a sample, a laser is used to scan each well.<br>
As more target molecules bind to the surface, more light is reflected and captured,<br>
delivering a clear signal of whatever is present in one step<br>
- such as antibodies for the novel coronavirus or other diseases,<br>
or the cytokine regulators of the body's immune system.<br>

<dd><b>At least 17 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates are currently in clinical trials</b><br>
An Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine candidate phase 2 trial conducted in China found<br>
it safely inducing an immune response, according to new research published in The Lancet.<br>

AstraZeneca's AZD1222 COVID-19 vaccine, AKA ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, passed a large test.<br>
It was generally safe, and it saw both antibody and T-cell immune responses,<br>
but needs confirmation.<br>
The median age was 35, much younger than the group which will need it most, i.e.,<br>
those over 70, and the majority of those getting the AZ vaccine had aches, headaches,<br>
fever and fatigue, though there doesn't appear to be anything more serious.<br>
Symptoms were generally controlled with paracetamol.<br>

A major virulence factor of SARS-CoVs is the nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1)<br>
 which suppresses host gene expression by ribosome association.&nbsp Structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy<br>
revealed that the Nsp1 C terminus binds to and obstructs the mRNA entry tunnel.<br>
Thereby, Nsp1 effectively blocks RIG-I-dependent innate immune responses<br>
that would otherwise facilitate clearance of the infection.<br>

We find that a resurgent continental epidemic could occur as many as 5 weeks earlier when<br>
well-connected countries with stringent existing interventions end their interventions prematurely.&nbsp Further,<br>
we found that appropriate coordination can greatly improve the likelihood of eliminating community transmission throughout Europe.<br>
In particular, synchronizing intermittent lockdowns across Europe meant half as many lockdown periods were required<br>
to end community transmission continent-wide.<br>

<dd><b>three distinct immune responses for COVID-19 patients</b><br>
The first immunotype had robust CD4+ T cell activity,<br>
with modest activation of CD8+ T cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes.<br>
CD4+ and CD8+ act as the main inflammatory immune cells that work to clear viruses.<br>
The second immunotype was characterized mainly by<br>
a subset of CD8+ T cells known as EM and EMRA<br>
and a modest activation of CD8+ T cells, memory B cells, and peripheral blood lymphocytes.<br>
The third immunotype showed little to no evidence of an immune response to the infection.<br>
The first immunotype was tied to more severe disease<br>
 that included inflammation, organ failure, and acute kidney disease.<br>
The second correlated not with disease severity<br>
but instead pre-existing immunosuppression and mortality.<br>
The third type was not associated with specific symptoms or clinical features,<br>
though they varied.<br>

Hebrew University of Jerusalem (HU)'s Professor Yaakov Nahmias and Dr. Benjamin tenOever<br>
at New York's Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai<br>
observed that SARS-CoV-2 prevents routine burning of carbohydrates,<br>
with fat accumulating inside lung cells, which may help<br>
explain why patients with high blood sugar and cholesterol levels are often at a particularly<br>
high risk to develop COVID-19. "By understanding how the SARS-CoV-2 controls our<br>
 metabolism, we can wrestle back control from the virus<br>
 and deprive it from the very resources it needs to survive."<br>
In lab studies, cholesterol-lowering drug Fenofibrate (Tricor) showed promising results.<br>
By allowing lung cells to burn more fat, fenofibrate prevents SARS CoV-2's reproduction.<br>
Within only five days of treatment, the virus almost completely disappeared.<br>

 from a level of about 1% where it had been since mid-June.<br>
 "It's also clear based on contact tracing that<br>
 many of the new cases in New York are a result of a lack of compliance<br>
 during the July 4 weekend and illustrate how quickly the virus spreads,<br>
 with one party, for example, infecting more than a third of attendees."<br>

SARS-CoV2 vaccines: Slow is fast<br>
Phase 3 trials are necessarily time consuming and require that<br>
infection among the control group is sufficiently high to draw a conclusion.<br>
In 1966, a large trial of a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) found that<br>
the immunized cohort actually faired significantly worse upon infection.<br>
There is some reason to worry that the same may occur with some SARS-CoV2 vaccines.<br>
Any immune response is of two types, adaptive or innate.<br>
Adaptive immunity is elicited by most vaccines and is mediated by lymphocytes.<br>
With the failed RSV vaccine, a lack of antibody affinity maturation caused the negative effect.<br>
There are potential reasons why an immune response to a vaccine can predispose an individual<br>
to a worse outcome upon infection.&nbsp One is the phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE).<br>
Troublingly, ADE has also been seen with vaccines for a feline coronavirus (6, 7).<br>
There is also evidence for ADE in SARS-CoV.<br>

 - Calibrating Restrictions during the COVID-19 Pandemic<br>
The relatively clear criteria for ending conventional quarantine and isolation<br>
 don't apply to social restrictions related to COVID-19.<br>
Transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 make it difficult to identify and target risk groups.<br>
More relevant than quarantine-based precedents<br>
are legal challenges to emergency curfews during natural disasters or civil unrest.<br>

The University of Oxford and its research center in China are launching Oxsed Limited,<br>
a new company to develop a rapid COVID-19 test that could cost about $25 U.S.<br>
"Our test is ideal for use in community or field settings by laypersons<br>
 and allows immediate decisions to be made"<br>
The single-step test generates a colored result in 30 to 45 minutes from a throat or nasal swab,<br>
 and can be read by the naked eye or a digital instrument.<br>
The simplified viral RNA test is based on RT-LAMP technology,<br>
for reverse transcription, loop-mediated isothermal amplification.<br>
The method uses less hardware than the PCR-based coronavirus lab tests in widespread use,<br>
which can require dozens of cycles of heating and cooling to drive the DNA reactions.<br>
"An advantage of using LAMP technology is that<br>
 it uses different reagents to most laboratory-based PCR tests"<br>

GlaxoSmithKline is continuing its strategy of giving out access to its vaccine platform as it partners with Canada-based Medicago,<br>
 to tie its recombinant coronavirus virus-like particles (CoVLP) with GSK's pandemic adjuvant system, which has been used in previous epidemics.<br>
CoVLPs mimic the structure of SARS-CoV-02, the virus responsible for COVID-19 disease, allowing them to be recognized by the immune system.<br>
  A phase 1 is planned within the next week or so and comes after preclinical testing (and the caveats that brings)<br>

<dd><b>Recovery (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 therapy)</b><br>
Large, randomized trials are the gold standard for testing drugs' efficacy,<br>
but they have been scarce so far in the COVID-19 pandemic.<br>
"Everybody has the first part about "randomized," but they omitted the "large" part,<br>
says Ana-Maria Henao Restrepo, a medical officer at WHO Emergencies Programme.<br>
In a sea of small, single institution studies, Recovery, with 12,000 patients<br>
 and hundreds of participating hospitals, stands out - and offers lessons for the few other megatrials,<br>
organized by WHO and other bodies, which have been slow off the mark.<br>

Saliva test is less sensitive than swab (more false negatives)<br>
The gold standard for detecting SARS-CoV-2 is a polymerase chain reaction (PCR).<br>
Both saliva and swab tests employ PCR, and saliva has several advantages:<br>
it is easier and less uncomfortable to take<br>
health-care workers may not need to collect<br>
reduced consumption of PPE and swabs, which might be in short supply<br>
However, a recent meta-analysis (not yet peer-reviewed) has shown<br>
detection from saliva is 13% less sensitive than a nasal swab<br>

To propagate, SARS-CoV-2's RNA-dependent polymerase (RdRp) is indispensable<br>
 for replicating its genome and generating additional RNAs via transcription.<br>
To treat Ebola, Gilead Sciences developed 'Remdesivir', an adenosine nucleotide analog chain terminator for RdRps,<br>
which incorporated into nascent viral RNA causes premature termination of viral-specific transcription.<br>
In both Gilead's uncontrolled study and NIH's double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial study,<br>
therapy with Remdesivir reduced recovery time for hospitalized patients with advanced COVID-19.<br>
10-day versus 5-day regimens of Remdesivir demonstrated similar positive outcomes,<br>
suggesting drug efficacy in a shorter time of therapy.<br>

<dd><b>3 vaccine approaches, animated</b><br>
* Just 2 of 14 coronavirus vaccine candidates in human trials<br>
&nbsp use old-school approaches, which have some drawbacks.<br>
* Vaccines that preview part of the virus are where most experts are laying their bets.<br>
&nbsp "It's tried and tested."  It's what you get with Hep B, HPV and whooping cough shots,<br>
&nbsp plus it's worked for coronaviruses in animal models in the past,<br>
&nbsp but growing virus proteins in a substance like yeast<br>
&nbsp and then separating it back out again is very difficult and takes months.<br>
* Genetic vaccines inject RNA , a genetic blueprint for the spike protein,<br>
&nbsp which directs your cells to build it inside of you, which in turn stimulates antibodies.<br>

Controlled Human Infection Models (CHIMs) are inappropriate for COVID-19<br>
CHIMs require infecting healthy persons with a well-characterized microorganis<br>
in order to study pathogenesis, characterize the immune response,<br>
and elucidate the efficacy of vaccines or therapeutics.   By design,<br>
the controlled nature of CHIMs limits their generalizability<br>
for predicting the effectiveness of a vaccine candidate against natural exposure.<br>
A model of disease in healthy young volunteers may have questionable scientific validity<br>
when extrapolated to older or other at-risk populations that have disproportionate morbidity.<br>
Moreover, correlates of protection from SARS-CoV-2 are poorly understood<br>
and may vary with the population or the vaccine construct.<br>
Virtually all recent CHIMs have involved microorganisms that either<br>
pose minimal risk for causing severe disease in the enrolled population,<br>
have effective oral treatments, or both.   Currently,<br>
we lack sufficient knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis<br>
to inform inclusion and exclusion criteria for a SARS-CoV-2 CHIM.<br>
A single death or severe illness in an otherwise healthy volunteer<br>
would be unconscionable and would halt progress.<br>

Kids and COVID-19:  what we know, what we kind of know,<br>
and what we need to do to know more.<br>
They are less likely to contract the disease, and if they do contract it,<br>
they are more likely to have a mild or asymptomatic case.<br>
Death rates are much lower.<br>
Children seem to transmit the virus less than do adults.<br>
Data from the Netherlands suggest that<br>
children are relatively unlikely to be the first case in a family cluster.<br>
School staff are not more likely than other occupations to contract the disease.<br>
Preschool and high-school teachers are actually less likely to get COVID-19.<br>
The highest-risk group here is drivers - of taxis and buses in particular.<br>

Common human respiratory coronaviruses infections are highly seasonal<br>
For 10 years, researchers from the University of Michigan (UM) School of Public Health<br>
have tracked occurrences of 4 types of human coronaviruses (OC43, 229E, HKU1, and NL63)<br>
in 890 to 1,441 individuals from 209 to 340 participating households and now track SARS-CoV-2.<br>
When year-round surveillance was in place, most coronaviruses cases were detected<br>
between December and April/May and peaked in January/February.<br>
Only 2.5% of cases occurred between June and September.<br>

Harvard public health experts said the nation's COVID-19 epidemic is getting "quite out of hand"<br>
and that, with cases rising rapidly in the hardest-hit states and a two-week lag<br>

"The increases that we're seeing right now have the capacity to cause far more disease in the future,"<br>
said William Hanage, associate professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.<br>

Coronavirus mutation has taken over<br>
When the first coronavirus cases in Chicago appeared in January,<br>
they bore the same genetic signatures as a germ that emerged in China weeks before.<br>
By May, a mutation associated with outbreaks in Europe and was found in 95% of all the genomes sequenced.<br>
Of approximately 50,000 genomes of the new virus that researchers worldwide have uploaded to a shared database,<br>
about 70% carry the mutation, officially designated D614G.&nbsp   The mutation doesn't appear to make people sicker,<br>

Researchers are working to develop cloth that could inactivate or repel coronaviruses<br>
Polyester material is printed with alternating spots of silver and zinc resembling polka dots<br>
one to two millimeters wide and spaced one millimeter apart.<br>
This "electroceutical" material functions as an ordinary fabric when dry, but if dampened<br>
- say, with saliva, vapor from a coughed up droplet or other bodily fluids -<br>
ions in the liquid trigger an electrochemical reaction.<br>
The silver and zinc then generate a weak electric field that zaps pathogens on the surface.<br>
A study posted on the preprint server ChemRxiv reported that<br>
its electroceutical fabric destabilized a coronavirus strain that causes<br>
a respiratory illness in pigs and on an unrelated type of pathogen called a lentivirus,<br>
leaving them unable to infect cells.<br>

Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and other cities across the country have not seen the sharp, sustained spikes<br>
that were predicted after hundreds of thousands protested against police brutality.<br>
With a 2 week COVID-19 incubation period, fallout should be clear by now.<br>
The leading theory to explain this paradox is that being outdoors is safer than indoors.<br>
Numerous studies support this.&nbsp Japanese researchers, for example,<br>
found coronavirus transmission indoors about 19 times greater than in the open air.<br>

DIY COVID-19 vaccine<br>
<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/05/19/science.abc6284">
A May Science paper</a> showed that a DNA vaccine seemed to provoke an immune response against SARS-CoV-2.<br>
The researchers developed multiple vaccines expressing different forms of the virus' spike protein and tested them in monkeys.<br>
Josiah Zayner and collaborators in Mississippi and Ukraine want to reproduce that experiment<br>
in humans - themselves - and livestream the process over several weeks.<br>
The scheme, dubbed Project McAfee, after the antivirus software, is possible thanks to the availability<br>
of new tools and technologies - including viral DNA - to the general public.<br>
The same spike protein used by researchers in their vaccine was ordered<br>
from a DNA synthesis company, having it put in a solution that could be injected.<br>

Far-UVC light (222 nm wavelength) penetrates neither eyes' tear layer nor skin's outer dead-cell layer,<br>
so it cannot damage living cells in the body,<br>
but researchers found it killed more than 99.9% of the virus with a very low exposure.<br>
Continuous exposure to far-UVC light at the current regulatory limit is estimated to kill<br>
90% of airborne viruses in about 8 minutes, 95% in about 11 minutes, 99% in about 16 minutes, and 99.9% in about 25 minutes.<br>

The air cooling system used in a German slaughterhouse,<br>
aimed at keeping temperatures at a cool 6-10 degrees Celsius<br>
but continually recycling the same untreated air into the room,<br>

a hygiene expert said Wednesday,<br>
a day after the mass outbreak triggered renewed lockdowns in the area.<br>
"The technology is there" to fix the problem, he said, pointing to<br>
high-performance mobile air filters that remove pollutants<br>

Fauci told a House panel Tuesday that the White House coronavirus task force was never told to slow down testing,<br>

About an hour after top public health officials denied that President Trump had ordered a slowdown in COVID-19 testing,<br>
news broke that the federal government was winding down support for local testing sites in states like Texas that continue to break daily case records.<br>
Dallas County, which has the second-highest number of cases in the state,<br>
will lose federal assistance at two testing sites, according to Rocky Vaz, director of emergency management.<br>
The city of Dallas would end up paying between $130 and $150 per test once federal help ends.<br>
Each site can perform 1,000 COVID tests per day.<br>

Herd immunity model accounting for population heterogeneity<br>
Classic herd immunity HC is 60% immunization for homogeneous populations and R0 = 2.5:<br>
HC = 1 - 1/R0<br>
Considered heterogeneously, e.g. with more vs less interactions within population segments,<br>
then immunities level HD within those differentiated herds can be lower,<br>
e.g. HD = 43% for R0 = 2.5.<br>
Varying interactions between segments further differentiates immunity levels.<br>

<dd><b>How superspreading fuels the pandemic</b><br>
By some estimates, 10% of infected cause 80% of new infections.<br>
In early March, a 57-year-old pastor and his wife, who both felt fine,<br>
attended a series of church events over three days,<br>
and the pastor returned for an additional Bible study group a few days later.  Soon after,<br>
they each started developing symptoms and eventually tested positive for the coronavirus.<br>
At least 33 of the other 92 event attendees later tested positive for COVID-19,<br>
and three of them died.&nbsp These cases then spawned more than two dozen others.<br>

Bad news:&nbsp they don't necessarily believe valid information, either.<br>
Just over a quarter of those surveyed claimed to have read or seen<br>

COVID-19 vaccine trials: "It's really complicated."</a></b><br>
1) Populations that have high levels of viral transmission are a moving target.<br>
 &nbsp Moderna's vaccine will enroll 30,000 people and take place<br>
 &nbsp primarily at U.S. hospitals and universities<br>
 &nbsp long used for HIV and flu vaccine testing<br>
 &nbsp and now overseen by Warp Speed's COVID-19 Prevention Network.<br>
 &nbsp But which of those brick-and-mortar sites will have enough SARS-CoV-2<br>
 &nbsp circulating near them to quickly produce an efficacy signal is uncertain<br>
 &nbsp given the shifting distribution of new cases in the United States.<br>
 &nbsp Beijing's Sinovac Biotech will stage efficacy trials of its vaccine candidate in Brazil,<br>
 &nbsp where the COVID-19 epidemic is now raging.<br>
<br>
2) Competition among trial efforts could hinder the global push.<br>
 &nbsp "everybody loves to collaborate unless they want to win"<br>
 &nbsp WHO has yet to announce its Solidarity test candidates, but,<br>
 &nbsp unlike Warp Speed "which won't consider Chinese-made vaccines"<br>
 &nbsp * it is open to products from every country, and<br>
 &nbsp * publicized detailed criteria for how it will prioritize vaccines.<br>
<br>
Sinovac Biotech announced preliminary study results on Saturday<br>
showing its experimental COVID-19 vaccine generated immune responses<br>
in "above 90%" of patients and was safe.<br>
<a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/06/14/sinovac-early-data-covid19-vaccine-generated-immune-responses/">

There are only 200 million vials left in the world because they've all been bought up.<br>
One in 10 new drugs make it to market;&nbsp  the U.S. has funded only 2 for COVID-19.<br>
An estimated $26 billion is needed to start producing the 10 most promising vaccines now.<br>
Existing production facilities are highly specialized for making a single, specific type of vaccine,
<br>like polio or measles, and they are currently reserved to make those vaccines.<br>
If those facilities are repurposed to make a new COVID-19 vaccine,<br>
it will put the supply of other critical vaccines at risk.<br>

treatment should be based on 3 COVID-19 phases<br>
1) the virus multiplies inside the body<br>
   &nbsp and is likely to cause mild symptoms that may be confused with a common cold or flu.<br>
2) the immune system becomes strongly affected by infection<br>
    &nbsp with symptoms such as persistent cough, shortness of breath and low oxygen levels.<br>
    &nbsp Problems with blood clotting may predominate.<br>
3) hyperinflammatory phase:  injury to the heart, kidneys and other organs<br>
<br>
* Plasma containing antibodies from recovered COVID-19 patients (i.e., hyperimmune plasma),<br>
 &nbsp which has been found to reduce the amount of live virus (viral load) in the early infection phase.<br>
* Antiviral drugs, including remdesivir, which have helped interrupt viral replication in Phase 1<br>
 &nbsp  and may continue to be beneficial in Phase 2.<br>

A noncompeting pair of human antibodies block COVID-19 virus binding to its receptor ACE2<br>
Two antibodies, B38 and H4, blocked the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein<br>
 from binding to the cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).<br>
The B38-binding site overlaps with the binding site for ACE2.<br>
Although H4 also blocks RBD binding to ACE2, it binds at a different site,<br>
and thus the two antibodies can bind simultaneously.<br>

<dd><b>vaccine enhancement is bad;&nbsp newly discovered graphics</b><br>
Vaccine-induced enhancement rendered vaccinated subjects more susceptible to infection<br>
 rather than protecting them.  Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) plays an important role.<br>

The story of COVID-19: A comparative analysis<br>
Using 7 models, SARS-CoV-2 virus was compared with<br>
"other common human respiratory pathogens that are known to cause significant morbidity",<br>
and showed "a modest interferon or antiviral response<br>
 but a longer and exuberant proinflammatory signal in the form of chemokines".<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine</a><br>
This "makes a stronger case for directing therapeutic strategies<br>
 against the proinflammatory milieu rather than the more classical antiviral response."<br>

Sofosbuvir as a potential alternative SARS-CoV-2 treatment<br>
The most highly conserved protein in all known RNA viruses is the viral monomeric RdRp.<br>
Several drugs that bind to the RdRp active site are approved to treat RNA viral diseases,<br>
 including Remdesivir, recently proven effective blocking SARS-CoV-2.<br>
Sofosbuvir (SOF) is a nucleotide analogue targeted against the HCV polymerase, NS5B.<br>
Previous work shows SOF has in vitro and/or in vivo antiviral activity against other Flaviviruses.<br>
SOF already has approval as a standard treatment and a well-known safety profile;<br>

What this coronavirus does to your body that makes it so deadly<br>
A coronavirus infection usually plays out one of two ways:<br>
 as a lung infection that includes some cases of what people would call the common cold,<br>
 or as an infection in the gut that causes diarrhea.<br>
COVID-19 starts out in lungs like common cold coronaviruses,<br>
but then causes havoc with the immune system.  It has many more ways<br>
than does influenza to stop cells from calling out to the immune system for help.<br>

"Although decisions to gradually reopen societies are ultimately based on<br>

"... holding officials accountable for demonstrating that orders are reasonable and necessary<br>
 - has been a robust scaffold for assessing the legality of public health orders<br>
 for more than a century, since it was announced in the seminal Supreme Court case of<br>
 Jacobson v. Massachusetts.&nbsp In addition to recognizing the need to give officials flexibility<br>
 to implement forceful public health interventions, Jacobson recognized that<br>
 administrative agencies are both nimbler and more expert than legislatures.<br>
 In upending this framework, the Wisconsin court did more than<br>

https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-30934/v1</a><br>
"The most straightforward explanation of the apparent famotidine activity as a COVID-19 therapy<br>
&nbsp;is that the drug acts via its antagonism or inverse-agonism of histamine signaling<br>
&nbsp;and via its arrestin biased activation - all a result of its binding to [histamine] H2.<br>
&nbsp;If true, then it is reasonable to infer that a SARS-CoV-2 infection<br>
&nbsp;that results in COVID-19 is at least partially mediated by pathologic histamine release."<br>

<b>bias</b><br>
> Everybody has a bias and it clouds their judgement.<br>
<br>
My bias is pessimistic, but<br>
I agree that is important for schools to reopen and worth some risk.<br>
What I suggested to my daughter for Northern VA schools,<br>
is that they consider allowing kids capable of remote learning to do so,<br>
freeing up some space to spread out those who cannot.<br>
<br>
The other key would be aggressive tracing and quarantining of new cases.<br>
Schools and parents would have to be prepared for students to be<br>
removed from classes and isolated immediately on suspicion of infection.<br>
<br>
I doubt whether many schools could open enough windows to adequately<br>
circulate air, even if clothing to keep kids comfortable were available.<br>
Most schools could never maintain HVAC filtration adequate to filter virus.<br>
Probably a lot of teachers speaking thru masks could not be understood,<br>
but even if teachers somehow avoided catching COVID-19 from asymptomatic kids,<br>
too many of those kids will probably take the virus home and kill baby-sitting elders.<br>
<br>
Other than having also written for Breitbart and other ultra-conservative media,<br>
I know nothing about this Daniel Horowitz (not the lawyer) other than what he has written,<br>
but I question whether he actually believes even half the stuff opined under his byline.<br>
FWIW, credible journalism generally does not cite sources such as <code>Gummi Bear</code> on <i>twitter</i>.<br>
While anonymous sources can be important, substantive confirmation is wanted.<br>
<br>
Beyond that,<br>
4 Canadian infectious disease self-proclaimed "experts" are not necessarily epidemiologists;<br>
they may be expert at treating infections without competence at managing viral outbreaks.<br>
It was, after all, an OPINION piece, not research.<br>
Those Canadians did publish that 95% of COVID-19 deaths are among those over 60.<br>

Of 342 confirmed cases in Beaufort Co, 12 have died, which is about 3.5%,<br>
but while folks 20-40 have been most likely to get sick,<br>
folks in our age group are more likely to die:<br>

Without better treatments and/or vaccination[s],<br>
chances of our being able to indefinitely avoid contracting the virus eventually approach zero.<br>
Where statistically significant antibody testing has been conducted to evaluate rates of asymptomatic to verified cases,<br>
NY had about 14% with antibodies as of Apr 23.<br>
Those take weeks to develop;&nbsp  NY had about 130K reported cases around April 1,<br>
 which is about 0.67% of population, so a 20:1 ratio.  Other places have estimated 6:1.<br>
<br>
That would put our risk of dying between 0.38% and 1.3%, provided that hospitals are not overwhelmed.<br>
On the other hand, I have not seen authoratative age breakdown for antibodies vs confirmed, but I suppose<br>
that less than half those our age get infected without serious symptoms,<br>
which gets us back nearer 8% risk of dying, again supposing hospitals not overwhelmed.<br>
<br>
New York City had 4 times the normal number of deaths, keeping in mind that its hospitals were NOT overwhelmed:<br>

<b>replacing animation by color coding</b><br>
IMO, identifying locations with increasing rates of infections<br>
is as important as comparing per capita new infections, but<br>
implementing that by animation felt clumsy.<br>
While switching from Johns Hopkins to USA facts<br>
(which data seems better, but formatted differently)<br>
I also decided to instead color-code most recent 3-day case increases:<br>
* pale red means latest 3-day increase is no greater than that for previous 3 days<br>
* dark red means latest increase is greater, perhaps growing out of control:<br>
New case rate changes can in theory be deduced by comparing red to  orange,<br>
but logarithmic distortion visually confounds that.  For example,<br>
compare relative sizes of red and orange section for NYC boroughs.<br>

<b>"successful" Infection = Exposure to Virus x Time</b><br>
Anyone you spend greater than 10 minutes with face-to-face is potentially infected.<br>
Anyone sharing space with you (say an office) for an extended period is potentially infected.<br>
At least 44% of all infections--and a majority of community-acquired transmissions--occur from people without symptoms.<br>
   20% of infected people are responsible for 99% of viral loads.<br>
<br>
Biggest outbreaks are in prisons, religious ceremonies, and workplaces<br>
such a meat packing facilities and call centers.&nbsp Any environment that is enclosed,<br>
with poor air circulation and high density of people, spells trouble.<br>

<br>
There is no real solution until vaccine and/or effective treatment and/or herd (what is left of it) immunity.<br>
Until then, this is mostly about the rate at which vulnerable get infected.<br>
As Fauci notes,
"The idea of having treatments available or a vaccine to facilitate
the re-entry of students into the fall term<br>
 would be something that would be a bit of a bridge too far."<br>
<br>
While most freak about exposing kids,<br>
numbers to date suggest they are less at risk than most others,<br>
and weird provisions that many workers would make instead of sending
them to school,<br>
such as baby-sitting by grandparents or unlicensed daycare, could have
worse outcomes.<br>
<br>
Perhaps a better approach is to let kids over 12 or so remote learn,<br>
then spread younger students among classrooms unused by teens.<br>
<br>
> NY is advertising free testing, no symptoms necessary to qualify on the news tonight.<br>
<br>
Great, that is presumably thanks to NY having developed their own tests.<br>
VA has sharply reduced testing, despite major growth in northern VA cases.<br>
Many spread the infection for a week before showing symptoms.<br>
NY also wants a better handle on what percentage have antibodies.<br>
<br>
Monday, VA had 989 positive results from 7562 tests, of which almost certainly most were of health workers.<br>
<br>
Similarly for SC<br>

Comparing to yesterday's graph, some places with relatively small (or no)<br>
orange may report mostly in multi-day batches.  Graphng weekly data
would smooth such results but delay showing serious increases,<br>
such nearly doubling over 3 days in Colleton, SC Bastrop, TX and Rappahannock, VA<br>
(keeping in mind logarithmic scaling, which visually deemphasizes counts from more than 20 days ago).<br>
<br>
This design intentionally portrays relative contagion risks;<br>
while e.g. Westchester NY has nearly twice as many recovered as currently contagious,<br>

It is a long read;&nbsp  to summarize:<br>
without an app based on Google/Apple smartphone tracing,<br>
this pandemic continues until immunity, which requires either:<br>
* vaccine[s], or<br>
* a majority having contracted it and, lacking effective treatments:<br>
   - deaths of most vulnerable 1-2 million U.S. residents, which is<br>

&gt; If you are to summarize all of your research<br>
&gt; do you think this boils down to a much worse second wave?
<br>
I watch daily briefings by NY Gov Cuomo, who points out<br>
that depends on how folks behave.  Just as with the first wave,<br>
localities will experience it at different times and strengths.<br>
<br>
I >>SUSPECT<< that, in much of the country,<br>
even if/when states implement tracing,<br>
many of those contacted and directed to isolate will NOT.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, if Trump prevails in forcing meat packers to reopen,<br>
a second wave in those communities will overwhelm their health systems<br>
and undertakers.  On the other hand, they will develop herd immunities...<br>
<br>
I expect a second wave here, starting around May 15,<br>
as vacationers pile into Hilton Head.<br>
With summer tourists continually arriving and leaving,<br>
appreciable herd immunity may not evolve.<br>
<br>
Since it is to me unclear whether/how much infection was spread in schools,<br>
I expect a second wave in some states to not wait for Fall<br>
and be indistinguishable from a prolonged first wave.<br>
<br>
My model suggests that 20% herd immunity may dampen a second wave,<br>
provided that infected populations are sufficiently depleted,<br>
which requires about 3 weeks of very few new cases.<br>
<br>
Refining my model wants more data and better visualizations;<br>
I am studying R and specifically tidyverse:<br>
https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html#prerequisites<br>
<br>
I suspect that Gov. Cuomo's 70% hospital occupancy threshold<br>
will prove to be sadly optimistic, given approx 10 day delays<br>
between infections and hospitalizations.  On the other hand,<br>
he may fear losing control by holding out for safer thresholds.<br>

<img width=600 src="https://sites.google.com/site/blekenbleu/Home/NYT.png"><br clear=all>
IMO, most recent 1 week would be more useful than 4 weeks..   Per-capita increases:<br>
.08% for Bluffton, SC;&nbsp  .06% for Auburn, NY,  .04% for Lexington, KY;<br>
.13% for Louisville;&nbsp  .08% for San Francisco;&nbsp  .07% for San Diego,  .14% for NYC<br>
.13% &amp .43% for Boulder &amp Greeley CO;&nbsp  .02% for Longview, WA;<br>
.08% for Austin, TX;&nbsp  .18% &amp .05% for St Louis &amp Jefferson City, MO<br>

Use Yale's cumulative density as a proxy for partial herd immunity:<br>

<img width=600 src="https://sites.google.com/site/blekenbleu/Home/yale.png"><br clear=all>
<br>
For example, 11% confirmed cases in Weld, CO implies significant herd immunity developing,<br>
which my model suggests could begin slowing growth within a month.<br>
Weld has intensive testing;&nbsp actual/confirmed is probably lower there than elsewhere.<br>
At 0.2%, Kershaw has highest cumulative cases in SC;<br>
6.5:1 actual to confirmed yields only 1.3%,  a long way from reducing growth.<br>
NYC reports 3.5% confirmed;&nbsp  antibody survey reported 21% (so 6:1);<br>
 partial herd immunity may be helping.<br>

I am no doctor, but then doctors are not engineers..<br>
<br>
r[0] supposes that, given a population with no resistance at time t=0,<br>
there is a meaningful ratio for<br>
<i>how many others will catch an infection from any spreader</i>.<br>
The SIR model postulates that, at any time,<br>
the rate of new infections is product of susceptible population s(t)<br>
<code>times</code> infected population i(t) <code>times</code> time-dependent factor r(t).<br>
Further, recovery rate d(r)/dt is some constant rate times the infected population<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_modelling_of_infectious_disease#The_SIR_model">
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_modelling_of_infectious_disease#The_SIR_model</a><br>
<br>
It is, IMO, silly to suppose that:<br>
* someone who just caught a disease is equally likely to "recover" at any time, and<br>
* infection rate for a given virus should appreciably change over time.<br>
<br>
Seemingly more credible:<br>
* some average period of time that folks are contagious, and<br>
* some probability that contagion occurs.<br>
<br>
Here are gnuplots based on my assumptions of:<br>
* 20 days average contagion, and<br>
* 1.5% or 2.5% probability of contagion during that period,<br>
* starting with a single carrier:<br>

Behavior drives contagion risk, as may perhaps weather/season..<br>
Something approximating "herd immunity" obtains<br>
after about double the peak interval.   Of course, if risky behavior increases,<br>
subsequent peaks are possible, with correspondingly higher herd immunity rates.<br>
This all supposes that non-trivial immunity actually occurs...<br>
<br>
While that roughly 20% peak contagious population seems scary,<br>
20% may not be all that far off what is happening with asymptomatic COVID-19...<br>
<br>

to approximate South Carolina statistics according to Washington Post:<br>
<img src="https://sites.google.com/site/blekenbleu/Home/WaPostSC.gif"><br clear=all>
...and predicted politics according to me.<br>
<br>
In the next graph, <b>C</b> represents the model's contagious population percentage,<br>
<b>R</b> represents recovered (no longer susceptible) and <b>S</b> represents remaining susceptible.<br>
<img src="https://sites.google.com/site/blekenbleu/Home/SC50.gif"><br clear=all>
Day 30 on the model graph corresponds to April 9, which was the peak day (so far)<br>
on the Washington Post graph.  The model switches from 1% to 2% contagion<br>
on day 41 (April 20), corresponding to SC governor reopening many businesses,<br>
noted reduction in mask wearing and increased traffic.<br>
* After a 7 day delay for new cases to get serious, publish cases spike.<br>
   In real life, spikes will spread with some getting sicker sooner or later..<br>
* Supposing resumed stay at home around April 30, that spike should relent,<br>
   delayed by another week or so.<br>
<br>
   The same model is plotted here for 300 days:<br>
<img src="https://sites.google.com/site/blekenbleu/Home/SC300.gif"><br clear=all>
Supposing the governor again reopens business around May 15,<br>
another, lower, spike provokes no reclosing.  By this time,<br>
the population percentage still susceptible will have been reduced so that<br>
resumption of more riskier behavior may not overtax the healthcare system...<br>

<dd><b>Re: COVID-19 Rt, "the effective reproduction number"</b><br>
<a href="http://systrom.com/blog/the-metric-we-need-to-manage-covid-19/">Here</a> is a blog post discussing their approach to <a href="https://rt.live/">estimating Rt</a>.<br>
My specific interest was how they estimate contagious populations,<br>
for which they reportedly use previous 7 days' positive tests.<br>
Since folks may be contagious for longer, this should overstate Rt.<br>
However, since positive test results understate actual infections,<br>
I consider their 7 day approximation as a fudge factor that was tuned<br>
to match their model to reported data.   Consequently, one could<br>
expect different fudge factors to better fit different populations at different times,<br>
depending on [mis]behaviors.<br>
<br>
Again, since their Rt proxy is effectively based on hospitalizations,<br>
it lags real active Rt by over a week.<br>
Since we have already seen positive test reported values double in under 2 days,<br>
a locality wants their rate before relaxing mitigations to be<br>
less than 10% of whatever is considered a tolerable rate,<br>
which might arguably be based on excess mortality..<br>
<br>
About half way down this blog post, Mr. Systrom ranks rates per state<br>
by median, then worst-case estimated values.<br>
This latter clusters states with fewest tests and least mitigations.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, while that makes LA appear to be in relatively good shape,<br>
I fear that it instead reflects recent testing biased towards folks with influence<br>
more that folks with symptoms.  Indeed, Louisiana's death rate remains relatively high:<br>

with residents dying without having been tested<br>
and sick folks electing to forgo hospitals and testing, given a lack of effective treatments.<br>
<br>
While excess mortality probably lags COVID-19 infections by over a month,<br>
it might at least help identify communities that may otherwise not get appropriate attention and assistance:<br>

The present mobility reduction has presumably also reduced flu infections and deaths.<br>
In some localities, e.g. where influenza rarely spreads, overall death rates may be<br>
lower than normal because of reduced motor vehicle usage and accidents.<br>
In a few places, deaths may have increased either by random bad luck<br>
or risky behavior such as driving faster because of less traffic on dangerous roads<br>

One concern is that their deaths peak about the same time as resources,<br>
when historical data indicates about 10-15 day delay

&gt; I listen to Gov Cuomo every day,<br>
&gt; and he has said for a few weeks that the death numbers will peak a week to 10 days after the peak of the hospitalizations.<br>
<br>
I have not found data for hospitalizations vs positive cases reported;<br>
my current best guess for NY is 13 day average delay from reported to deaths.<br>
3.5 weeks ago, it appears to have been around 7 days delay,<br>
then 10 days from 2 to 3 weeks ago<br>
and 12 days delay 1 week ago.<br>
Today, Cuomo reported that hospitalizations are down.<br>
I only access data for the state, which continues reporting relatively<br>
constant 10K new cases per day,<br>
so hospitalizations may be down in NYC metro area but up elsewhere...?<br>

To visualize whether/when cresting occurs in selected states,<br>
my first chart plots growth in positive tests between April 5 and 7.<br>
<img src="https://sites.google.com/site/blekenbleu/Home/ActiveGrowth.gif"><br clear=all>
AZ is behaving, CT is doomed and GA will pay for their governor's foolishness.<br><br>
Since any sick folks that we personally know are not included,<br>
a second chart plots percentage testing growth vs percentage of population,<br>
keeping in mind that many tests are duplicates for critical workers.<br>
<img src="https://sites.google.com/site/blekenbleu/Home/COVIDtest.gif"><br clear=all>
<br>
COVID data from states with tests < 1% of population are IMO suspect.<br>
NC is flying blind.  CA  is waiting for results from nearly half its tests.<br>
Only 4 states report positive COVID for more than 1/1000: NY, NJ, MI, WA.<br>
Other states may have less COVID or insufficient testing.<br>
MI is interesting;&nbsp after bad-mouthing its governor,<br>
someone presumably pointed out to Trump that he would need their votes.<br>
<br>
Since <a href="https://covidtracking.com">https://covidtracking.com</a> reports cumulative totals,<br>
a third plot subtracts Mar 22 totals from April 7 totals,<br>
(supposing most reported cases remain active for about another 2 weeks)<br>
and compares that difference to Mar 29 total.  Except for WA, that reduces totals by < 10%.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://sites.google.com/site/blekenbleu/Home/ActiveGrowth1.gif"><br clear=all>
While not all active cases are hospitalized,<br>
scaling to better approximate states' healthcare stress now uses<br>
available beds (from <a href="https://covid19.healthdata.org">https://covid19.healthdata.org</a>) rather than population.<br>
CT and NJ should soon be getting as much attention as NJ.<br>
For the 4 states with most active cases per hospital bed,<br>
their rates of reported case increases over the last week<br>
are negatively correlated to their active case loads,<br>
which could mean that distancing is beginning to work for them<br>
or they are too stressed to fully report.<br>

Missouri is worrying, but perhaps reflects better test reporting now than earlier.<br>
This also does not capture how risky is typical behavior away from home...

I should have also tabulated states' percentage of population tested,<br>
but even then would not know how much bias/credibility for<br>
establishing error bars...<br>
As time goes on, many of the same critical workers may be retested,<br>
which is not being delineated.
