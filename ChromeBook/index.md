 *received 28 July*
My solitary C340 arrived today in a sealed Lenovo box.
Somewhat evocative of my now-ancient MacBook Pro;
less tapered and a darker gray (no illuminated apple logo)...
It fired up a few seconds after plugging in its USB-C charger.
It needed a (~5 minute) update.
It tried and failed to sync settings without first asking for my passphrase...
