 *received 28 July*  
My solitary C340 arrived today in a sealed Lenovo box.  
Somewhat evocative of my now-ancient MacBook Pro;  
less tapered and a darker gray (no illuminated apple logo)...  
It fired up a few seconds after plugging in its USB-C charger.  
It needed a (~5 minute) update.  
It tried and failed to sync settings without first asking for my passphrase...

## Ordered a USB-C dock with DisplayPort  
[Cable Matters' USB C hub](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076TRGGM6) works perfectly with this Chromebook.

As Amazon reviewers noted, the single USB-2 port can be limiting,  
but in this case is used for the USB connection from my Apple 27" Cinema Display (also via MiniDP adapter),
![](Cinema.jpg)  
Except that the Cinema display is *significantly* brighter than the C340's,  
they are otherwise nearly so compatible as is the MacBook Pro for which the display was originally purchased.  
Cinema display speakers automagically play from the C340, and it has USB ports on the back,  
to which a keyboard and mouse are plugged, being a fan of neither touchpads nor touch screens.

It mounts the 1TB NTFS USB drive attached to our network router, which is used for FLAC music, images  
and e.g. PDF files that are shared among my several PCs and Macs.
