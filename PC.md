Tower PC misguided buying rant[s]

### Background

<details>
<summary>more than usual, buying now sucks [<i>click for details</i>]</summary>
<br>
Some years, it may not matter whether a new PC has the latest processor.<br>
2022 is <b>NOT</b> one of those years.<br><ul compact>
<li> Apple has bailed on Intel processors
<li> 12th gen Intel processors are usefully more powerful/price than 10th, 11th or AMD<ul compact>
  <li> but no longer support <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-intel-chips-wont-play-blu-ray-disks-due-to-sgx-deprecation">Blu-ray disk playback</a></ul>
<li> Component price scalping puts DIY at a cost disadvantage
<li> Even arguably reputable PC reviewers recommend PCs built with proprietary components<ul compact>
  <li> techradar.com's top 2022 pick is obsolete
  <li> similarly for tomshardware.com</ul>
<li> "Desktop" is meaningless for PCs<ul compact>
  <li> many are all-in-ones, AKA laptops with delusions of grandeur</ul>
<li> "Gaming PC" includes laptops; "Gaming desktop" excludes some potentially superior alternatives<ul compact>
  <li> e.g. <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/pdr/xps-8950-desktop/cto8950w11padl4?selectionState=eyJPQyI6ImN0bzg5NTB3MTFwYWRsNCIsIk1vZHMiOlt7IklkIjo2LCJPcHRzIjpbeyJJZCI6IkdORzE5N0QifV19LHsiSWQiOjgsIk9wdHMiOlt7IklkIjoiRzlBWUVWUCJ9XX0seyJJZCI6MTE2LCJPcHRzIjpbeyJJZCI6IkdGVkdMMlcifV19XSwiVGkiOiIiLCJEaSI6IiJ9&cartItemId=">Dell XPS 5950</a>,
     but optional liquid CPU cooler is lame..
</ul>
<li> Z690: DDR4 is quickly becoming obsolete;  DDR5 is being scalped.
<li> Gamers Nexus may be relatively credible and current, but information density is low</ul>

### Not all major vendors offer 12G Intel; these currently do  
* Dell and Alienware  
  - [DDR5 at DDR4 price? ($2880)](https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/pdr/xps-8950-desktop/cto8950w11padl4?selectionState=eyJPQyI6ImN0bzg5NTB3MTFwYWRsNCIsIk1vZHMiOlt7IklkIjo2LCJPcHRzIjpbeyJJZCI6IkdORzE5N0QifV19LHsiSWQiOjgsIk9wdHMiOlt7IklkIjoiRzlBWUVWUCJ9XX0seyJJZCI6MTE2LCJPcHRzIjpbeyJJZCI6IkdGVkdMMlcifV19XSwiVGkiOiIiLCJEaSI6IiJ9&cartItemId=)
* HP  
  - [12700K + RTX 3080 Ti $3440](https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/ConfigureView?langId=-1&storeId=10151&catEntryId=3074457345620106819&configId=3K1G5AV_100021&a=1&jumpid=cs_con_nc_ns&utm_medium=cs&utm_source=ga&utm_campaign=HP-Store_US_All_PS_All_Hgm_OPEX_Google_ALL_Smart-PLA_PCs&utm_content=sp&adid=535232761907&addisttype=u&3K1G5AV_100021&cq_src=google_ads&cq_cmp=13987943907&cq_con=130783845331&cq_term=&cq_med=&cq_plac=&cq_net=u&cq_pos=&cq_plt=gp&gclid=CjwKCAiA0KmPBhBqEiwAJqKK4z4-K844nSTvpGWhsBUf7fb8qRZ0R9NZobebRv0jbKzvuthAXh8xGxoCf-wQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)

  - [ADATA XPG white 12700KF, 4x8GB DDR4-3600, RTX 3080, 1TB NVMe Gen 4 $2992](https://www.ibuypower.com/Store/Intel-12th-Gen-Z690-i7-DDR4-Gaming)

### Bottom Line  
* Pick CPU and GPU first
  - but no vendor supports this, most force case selection,  
    then limit CPUs or GPUs allowed
* Few if any builders offer CPU air coolers
  - perhaps to avoid issues with motherboard and DRAM interference
  - liquid coolers are more liable to problems
  - iBUYPOWER seems to allow selecting liquid coolers (e.g. 280mm)  
    that would not fit e.g. [ADATA XPG Invader case](https://www.adata.com/us/xpg/638)
    which has 170mm CPU air cooler clearance

#### [CPU air coolers sorted by height](https://www.xtremegaminerd.com/cpu-coolers-by-height)
  - [Cooler Master MasterAir MA624 Stealth](https://www.coolermaster.com/catalog/coolers/cpu-air-coolers/masterair-ma624-stealth) is 165.1mm high, [rated highly by tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-cpu-coolers,4181.html)  
  - [Noctua NH-D15](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L7UZMAK) w/140mm fans  
    ![diagram](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media-library-service-media/25d8ba96-dc2f-476c-9361-ef4ddbc37daa.__CR0,0,300,300_PT0_SX300_V1___.jpg)  

### Ranking the rankers: custom PC builders by reviewers who seemingly have not actually use them
- [techguided](https://techguided.com/best-custom-pc-builders) ranks iBuyPower first, citing *affordable*  
  and seemingly ignoring customer support and quality issues.

  - [xidax](https://www.xidax.com/desktops) was rated second,  
    but is another that wants users to waste time guessing which models offer what CPUs and GPUs  
    Hint: X-6 and lower do NOT support Z690  
    They still offer a BD-RW drive, which as noted above is NOT supported by 12G Intel CPUs  
    Their X-6i Edge Light white case seeming supports 360mm coolers  

  - [BLD ny NZXT](https://nzxt.com/build/fa1e4fe3-75cc-40c3-843b-55efc741b3fd) appears to be stuck on 11G Intel with H510 chipset  

  - [Origin](https://www.originpc.com/gaming/desktops) has a compare option  
    and seemingly allowed full CPU and GPU choices in their second-cheapest line,
    but restricted Intel choices to 11G once selected.

  - [Maingear VYBE](https://maingear.com/product/maingear-vybe-custom-q4-2021/) custom selection was fairly easy,
    but limited to a black case @ $2995.  

  - Digital Storm allows CPU and GPU in any case,  
    but opaque DRAM configuration option, e.g. 1x32 vs 2x16 vs 4x8GB  
    About 10% more ($3300 vs $3000) for comparable configuration

  - [**CyberPowerPC**](https://www.cyberpowerpc.com/system/IEM-Champion) has quick selection of CPU and GPU in left column
    with a white high airflow case for $2528.  
    Easy config with great (IMO) choices.

  - [AVA Direct](https://www.avadirect.com/12th-Gen-Intel-Core-processors-Z690-Chipset-Custom-Gaming-PC/Configure/14666090) selection seems clunky,  
    but offers DH-15 Noctua cooling option, at a considerable premium ($144)  
    Comparable system cost about $3650.
    Configurator warns of incompatibilities;  
    trying to change the case after selecting internals **failed badly**.

- [The TECHLOUNGE](https://www.thetechlounge.com/best-custom-pc-builders) adds a few others
  - [Puget Systems](https://www.pugetsystems.com/nav/core) sorts first by CPU
    Limited, but OK, configuration options with $4253 cost
    Black cases only.  

  - [Velocity Micro](https://www.velocitymicro.com/wizard.php?iid=2) similar to Puget
    Limited, but OK, configuration options with $4150 cost, black case only..

  - Alienware??
