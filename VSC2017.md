### sharing Visual Studio Community 2017 (VCS2017)
*Windows C# programming pretty much requires VSC2017...*    

### Background
* Hobbyist debugging projects using custom client USB drivers
  * practically, Windows drivers must all be signed, a tedious process
  * as of Windows 10 1809,  [Universal Windows Drivers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/develop/getting-started-with-universal-drivers) are wanted.
  * Windows Driver Frameworks (WDF) drivers do NOT work on earlier Windows
  * need to debug on **Windows Home** 8.1, 10 and perhaps [Insider Preview](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/previews-highlights/)
  * my PC has *only one* SATA III channel for SSD;  
    * UEFI boot manager selects among bootable SSD Windows partitions
  * need to minimize C:\ space usage; SSD wear increases nonlinearly for > 50%.

### Problem
*  VSC2017 spreads ~ 6.24 GB among `C:\Program Files (x86)` folders:
   * Windows 8.1 folders *with VSC2017*, compared to Windows 10 *without*:
   * 3.16 MB `Windows Phone Kits`
   * 5.38 GB `Microsoft SDKs`
   * 236 B   `NuGet`
   * 2.27 MB `IIS`
   * 349 MB  `Common Files`             *(35.3 MB on Win 10)*
   * 308 KB  `Application Verifier`
   * 104 MB  `Entity Framework Tools`
   * 26.7 MB `Microsoft.NET`              *(28 KB on Win 10)*
   * 29.1 MB `Windows Kits`
   * 1.54 MB `Microsoft SQL Server`
   * 209 MB  `MSBuild`                    *(36 KB on Win10)*
   * 156 MB  `Microsoft Visual Studio`
* Beyond SSD space constraints,  
  *maintaining* multiple VSC2017 instances would be problematic
* Visual Studio has been thru many interations, presumably with different champions
   * camel: horse [designed by a committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_committee)
   * Windows 10 registry has 4525 `VC`, 54 `VisualStudio` and 13 `Visual Studio` entries
   * Windows 8.1 now has 12922 `VC`, 5172 `VisualStudio` and 175 `Visual Studio` entries...
* Normal VSC2017 installation allows some content elsewhere
   * custom installation terminologies and contexts are unclear and incomplete  
     when not simply misleading
   * [vswhere](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/tools-for-managing-visual-studio-instances)
     reports nothing on Windows 10,  
     even when invoked from (Windows 8.1) installation directory
     - presumably addicted to registry entries
   * [PowerShell tool](https://github.com/Microsoft/vssetup.powershell) is "more powerful"..
   * Installing multiple VS versions [side-by-side](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio-versions-side-by-side?view=vs-2015&viewFallbackFrom=vs-2017) on a single PC is not interesting to me  

#### *possibly* interesting
* who knows?
* [Microsoft.VisualStudio.Setup.Configuration.Native](https://nugetmusthaves.com/Package/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Setup.Configuration.Native)  
     "adds the header location and automatically links the library."
* [--path shared=<path>](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/command-line-parameter-examples?view=vs-2017)??
* Visual studio [SharedInstallationPath](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/set-defaults-for-enterprise-deployments?view=vs-201)
```
Registry keys
There are several locations where you can set enterprise defaults,
to enable their control either through Group Policy or directly in the registry.
Visual Studio looks sequentially to see if any enterprise policies have been set;
as soon as a policy value is discovered in the order below, the remaining keys are ignored.

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\VisualStudio\Setup
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\VisualStudio\Setup
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\VisualStudio\Setup (on 64-bit operating systems)
```
  * "enterprise"
    * not for community edition?
    * not for Windows Home?  VisualStudio does not exist in first key on my PC..
    * what gets put there?  second key has CachedPath and SharedInstallationPath set to custom location,
      leaving 6.24 GB on C:
    * Setup does not exist for the third key

  * supposing **SKUs** in that claim refers only to content optionally installed elsewhere,
    but registry shows 5916 references to that location
