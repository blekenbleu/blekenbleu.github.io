<h2>SideSlip (AKA lateral velocity) and numerical integration</h2>
There is a lateral acceleration required to follow a curve = V*V/R,
<br>where V is speed and R is curve's radius
<br>and then there is lateral acceleration actually currently being developed.
<br>Some call the difference "SideSlip rate",<br>
which integrated over time yields "lateral velocity".

<p>Calculate SideSlip or lateral velocity by
<a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/FSAE/comments/125moie/comment/je6it6q/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button>integrating SideSlipRate</a>,
<br>which in turn is calculated by
<br>&emsp; <code>AccelerationSway - SpeedKmh * OrientationYawVelocity</code>.
</p>Numerical integration is problematic in that errors can accumulate.
<br>Most traditional numerical integration techniques fail for near real time,
<br>wanting information about future samples.
<br>Lacking those, perform simple-minded accumulation.
<br>To minimize error accumulation,
<br>note that <i><b>SideSlip should approach zero</b></i>
<br>for small steering angles and lateral accelerations.
<br>Consequently, apply lowpass filtering to accumulation,
<br>introducing zero values with time constant decreasing
<br>as steering angles and lateral accelerations approach zero.</p>

<p><b>SideSlip <i>Angle</i> Rate</b> factors speed out of SideSlip rate:
