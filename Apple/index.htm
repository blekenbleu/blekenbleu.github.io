<dt><b>AirPod Pro:&nbsp hateful hearing UI</b>
<dd>Bottom line:&nbsp no practical speech intelligibility improvement
<dd>Your mileage may vary, but in this case:<ul>
<li>paired to 2020 iPhone SE iOS 17.4, with neither Siri nor Music app
<li>AirPod configuration and settings buried in too many iPhone submenus
<li>AirPods randomly and spontaneously change Noise Control settings.
<li>At least on my iPhone, unable to disable both Off and Noise Cancellation setting
<li>Short battery life might be addressed by charging one pair while wearing another,<br>
but then BlueTooth pairing hassles
<li>At least on my pair, only left AirPod controls noise mode
<li>iPhone noise control settings are bizarrely pointless and stupid:<ul>
	<li>separate <b>Left</b> and <b>Right</b> controls??<br><img src=idiotic1.png><br><br>
	<li>most check marks cannot be unchecked<br><img src=idiotic2.png><br><br>
	<li>Even with Noise Cancellation unchecked,<br> AirPods spontaneously switch to that mode.
	</ul>
	</ul>
<dt><br>Emphatically NOT task oriented
<dd>Typical in my experience for event driven object oriented programming,<br>
as perpetrated by oversized enterprises.
