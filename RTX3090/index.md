RTX 3090 for Assetto Corsa VR
---
*updated 15 Feb 2021*

#### Background
[Assetto Corsa Ultimate Edition](https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/6998/Assetto_Corsa_Ultimate_Edition/) can be had for $7.93
An RTX 3090 GPU lists for around $1500   
and is barely faster than an RTX 3080 listing for half that, although neither are generally available.  
My two-generation-old Alienware Aurora 7 with GTX 1080Ti has a power supply rated to support an RTX 3090,  
but lacks both space and cooling capacity.  
Alienware motherboard is proprietary; moving components to a better case could be problematic.

Rationales for RTX 3090 over 3080 are
* 3090 are somewhat easier to find and less overpriced.
* RTX 3080 RAM is IMO scant e.g. for high resolution VR.  The anticipated 3080TI may solve that..
* While Tower PCs with RTX 3080 have been listed for under $2000,  
  - current ones often exceed $2400, making $3000 for RTX 3090 relatively competitive  
  - Prebuilt RTX 3090 PCs typically have better power supplies and cooling.  
    The MSI Aegis RS RTX 3080 version with 120mm cooler runs hot, according to several Best Buy reviews  

#### Selection
At $3K, the [MSI Aegis RS 10TH-061US Gaming Desktop Tower](https://us-store.msi.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=632) intrigued:

* airflow-strangling front panel pops off, leaving an intake filter and improving cooling  
* while no formal RTX3090 Aegis review exists, customer reviews are good, excepting one power supply failure
```
 Mostly using the pc for gaming and some occasional photo and video editing,
 was excited to see a computer with a 3090 for around $3000.
 Many other companies charge similar for a pc with a 3080.

 Anyway, ran Cyberpunk 4K maxed with art at 55-60 FPS. Can super sample 300-400% in steamvr
 with oculus quest 2 and Virtual desktop. Very glad with what I got.
 Only issue is 2gb mechanical drive is loud, so swapped it with 4TB drive from my old computer
 and am very happy with this machine overall. Fans are not loud on CPU, Case, or GPU
 and heat seems to stay less than 70 degrees.
 Haven't overclocked anything, and don't really need to since I'm getting 60 FPS 4K.

 I'll say I was quite surprised to find out all the parts are quality components.
 I thought for sure there would be some price saving in the build but I was wrong.

 The most modern version of all the manufacturer parts that were used. A good selection for a fair price

 I took it apart and put it back together just to inspect everything myself
 and as a builder myself if say worth the price for sure if you were already in the market for this gpu
```
```
 looking down the components list, there are things I can't even get right now (3090 card),
 nevermind get them at a better price. My only glitch is that I wish MSI would do
 a better job of updating their website and include a user manual for the computer. 
```
```
 Bought this pre-built as finding a new 3090 alone isn't worth it
 when you can get a full pc for a little more.
 This is the best bang for the buck 3090 pc that I have found so far.
 You literally don't need anything else,
 although I did stick 32gb of 3466mhz ram from my other pc in this one.
 Mine came with the msi z490 a pro motherboard, ventus 3x oc 3090.
 Comes with Norton pre-installed and good for 3 months. I am very pleased with the pc,
 only gripe is the case could probably use some better airflow in the front.
 I run about 70c on my GPU playing apex at 190 fps capped on 1440p stable.
 I OC'd the i7 10700 to 5.0 ghz and the GPU is at +75 core/+500 memory through afterburner.
 This pc paired with the Samsung g7 monitor is a game changer coming from console gaming.

* MSI sells most components separately, and those have reviews.
* except for front cover, marginal power supply and silly RGB, most components seem OK DIY options
* proprietary Aurora R7 left a bad taste, but no enthusiasm for [DIY build](https://pcpartpicker.com/builds/)
* a white case would offer better maintenance visibility;
  - only one [DIY RTX 3090 build with i7-10700K build](https://pcpartpicker.com/b/hQx6Mp) cost less than $3000 ($2979),  
    but uses a B460M micro ATX motherboard
  - currently cheapest real (used) eBay RTX 3080 is $1700.

  [360R review](https://www.kitguru.net/components/cooling/james-dawson/msi-mag-coreliquid-360r-aio-cpu-cooler-review/6/):  thermal performance proved to be slightly underwhelming;  
  it simply cannot match the performance of other coolers of a similar size.

  - bad airflow with front panel on
  - mesh filters front, top and below power supply
  - could use a vent on the bottom
  - perhaps a bit more space on the reverse side?
  - sheet metal is thicker and stronger / premium feeling
