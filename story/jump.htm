<title>Dad's jump</title>
</head> 
<body>
When we were kids, Dad would occasionally volunteer a story,<br>
but Mom would fume and fuss over disputed details.

<h4>Dad's jump</h4>
Like many, Pearl Harbor inspired my Dad to enlist,<br>
but he was rejected because of heart damage from a car crash.<br>
Instead, he worked as a civilian at Rome Air Force Base,<br>
repairing and inspecting damaged bombers, mostly B-17 and B-24.<br>

<h5>Sabotage was a real thing</h5>
Dad told of complaints from federal investigators<br>
of his suspected sabotage reports<br>
that they already had many copies of his fingerprints,<br>
but much suspected sabotage was discovered by touch,<br>
reaching into areas out of sight.<br>
<br>I speculate that
nearly cut thru <a href="https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2017/september/11/maintaining-flight-control-cables">control cables</a> would be likely sabotage.<br>
<br>
Consequently, maintenance crews were required to be onboard<br>
for check-out flights after repairs were signed off.<br>
My understanding is that the B-17 from which he bailed<br>
was crippled by failure of a voltage regulator that had <i>not been</i> written up.<br>
<br>
As crew chief, Dad was among the last to bail out.<br>
"The guy who was supposed to go before Dad was scared and told Dad he would be out right behind him.<br>
&nbsp Dad lived, the guy who didn't go when he was supposed to died as a result.<br>
&nbsp Dad felt wrong about that ever after." - Carol.

<li>By the time they gave up and bailed, the plane was flying too low
for chutes to fully deploy<br> before earlier jumpers struck the leading side
of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_Pennsylvania#The_mountains">Allegheny mountain</a>.<br>

<li>Those jumping later survived because their trajectory went down the trailing side.
</ul>
<br>
At least, that is what I recall deducing from the little that I heard about it.<br>
I am similarly unsure whether he sketched something like that diagram on the back of an envelope<br> or that is what I merely visualized.<br><br>
Carl still has Dad's diary from those years.<br>
Being Dad, he reused the same 1 year book,<br>
so that some adjacent entries were from different years.<br>
with most entries about carpool expenses and repairs.<br><br>

Jump survivors were allowed to keep their parachutes.<br>
Dad's ended up as filters in the New Hope flour mill sifters;<br>
"much of the parachute silk gave its all to <i>soft as silk</i> pastry flour."

<pre>Bill drove - We had only the daily
on B-17, and I conversed awhile
with E. Winchell on shapes & personal
We / Al Wright, Wesley Opew, Capt. Friesz
Capt. Oammack, A Fiduccia & I took
off at 1:25 in B-17-168 - Ithaca -
Elmira - Lake Erie - Warren Pa. - Troupsburg
crashed about 4:10 saw Wright & Friesz
met Tony and Capt. on mt. where -17 crashed
Left Troupsburg about 9 in convoy - put
up at Mark Twain Hotel - drinks with
Col. Hartman - Maj Harrman - and about
4 or 5 capt.'s turn in at 2:00</pre><ul>
<li>Elmira's Mark Twain Hotel had "been the city's showcase for nearly 35 years."

<li>"Tony" is presumably also "A(thony) Fiduccia"
<li>A friend, Frankie Prino, was killed in another plane crash, probably war-related.
</ul><br>
Mom did not hear anything that night, so spent it worrying that she might be a widow.<br>
An alarm of some sort going off at the base notified locals that something was amiss...<br><br>

Dad badly sprained an ankle and was given time off.<br>
A later diary entry
about going hunting with his brother, our Uncle Lee,<br>
was <i>instead of resting</i> and giving his ankle time to heal;&nbsp
he had ankle trouble thereafter.<br><br>
