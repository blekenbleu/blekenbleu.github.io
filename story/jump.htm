When we were kids, Dad would occasionally volunteer a story,<br>
but Mom would fume and fuss over disputed details.

<h4>Dad's jump</h4>
Like many, Pearl Harbor inspired my Dad to enlist,<br>
but he was rejected because of heart damage from a car crash.<br>
Instead, he worked as a civilian at Rome Air Force Base,<br>
repairing damaged bombers, mostly B-17 and B-24.<br>

<h5>Sabotage was a real thing</h5>
Dad told of complaints from federal investigators<br>
of his suspected sabotage reports<br>
that they already had many copies of his fingerprints,<br>
but much suspected sabotage was discovered by touch,<br>
reaching into areas out of sight.<br>
<br>
Consequently, maintenance crews were required to be onboard<br>
for check-out flights after repairs were signed off.<br>
My understanding is that the bomber from which he had to bail<br>
was crippled by failure of a voltage regulator that had not been written up.<br>
<br>
As crew chief, Dad was last to bail out.<pre>

By the time they gave up trying to continue, the plane was flying too low<br>
for chutes to fully deploy before others struck the leading side
of an Adirondack mountain peak.<br>
Being last, Dad survived because his trajectory went down the trailing side.<br>
<br>
At least, that is what I recall deducing from the little that I heard about it.<br>
I am similarly unsure whether he sketched something like that diagram on the back of an envelope or that is what I merely visualized.<br><br>

Last I knew, Carl still had Dad's diary from those years.<br>
Being Dad, he used the same 1 year book,<br>
so that some adjacent entries were from different years.<br>
with most entries were about carpool expenses and repairs.<br><br>

I recall no diary entries about the crash, but a few about his recovery,
then being able to go hunting with his brother, our Uncle Lee.<br><br>

Jump survivors were allowed to keep their parachutes.<br>
My impression was that most of that silk ended up as
filters in the New Hope flour mill.<br>
