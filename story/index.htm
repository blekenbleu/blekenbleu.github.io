<h3>Stories</h3>
At Lexmark, I wrote code for <a hef="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%E2%80%93Penrose_inverse">Moore-Penrose inverse</a> more than once,
having misplaced a first version.&nbsp
Significantly smaller than others, my algorithm was not embedded in products,
being instead used to generate tables that were embedded.&nbsp
Consequently, filing for a patent was unnecessary, but it now occurs
to me that publishing it might have yielded some professional visibility.&nbsp
Even that second derivation took a week or two,
and recreating it now is probably beyond me.&nbsp
One night recently,
I woke up thinking about inflection points while working at IBM and Lexmark.&nbsp
Before forgetting more of them, here are related anecdotes.
