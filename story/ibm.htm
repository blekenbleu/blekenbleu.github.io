<h3>IBM</h3>
<pre>
My "defense" contractor "career" ended after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Linebacker_II">Christmas bombing</a>, which meant that
I lost my beard and long hair to attend Signal Corps Officer Basic Training, near Augusta GA,
after which Hazeltine planned my deployment to Turkey, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_invasion_of_Cyprus">which was preparing to invade Cyprus</a>,
while also sending contractor support to Greece.  This struck me as <i>a really bad idea</i>,
but a college friend already working for IBM finagled me interviews in Endicott.
Officer basic <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/101#22">active duty for training</a> occurred before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Saigon">Fall of Saigon</a>;
I may, in theory, be <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2004-title5-vol1/pdf/CFR-2004-title5-vol1-sec307-103.pdf">a Vietnam veteran</a>..?!

One opening was as a System 370 microcoder; seeing a row of guys pounding away on keypunches,
I visualized pencils being ground to stubs.  Another opening was in Cost Engineering,
about which I knew nothing, but that manager was impressive, and engineering is essentially economic deployment of resources,
so this would be a learning experience.  Naturally, that manager vanished within months of my employment.
Having been hired with notably more experience than typical engineering grads, I started as a senior associate
instead of the usual junior associate.  While this meant that the usual 6 month probation was skipped,
it also resulted in my not being promoted until well after relocating to Charlotte.
A more astute IBMer would have known that a promotion could have been negotiated as part of that relocation.

As a field engineer, I would brag about reading electronics schematic diagrams the way others might read comic books.
That was of no use as an IBM cost engineer, where my assignment was to estimate scrap and rework costs for the mythical FS.
Symbolically, cost engineers were obliged to meticulously account weekly for how their 40 hours were consumed,
and I would always include at least an hour for that accounting, but was directed to charge most of my time against
so-called recon products.  IBM mostly leased mainframes, and obsolete models returned from lease would be
reconned into peripheral controllers.  While IBM's mainframe success was largely based on having sorted
backward compatibility, their mid-range commercial mainframes were cost-competitive mostly because of fast I/O
than raw compute speed.  IBM allocated costs according by so-called waterfall, where a burden was added to labor
by distributing indirect costs (e.g. my salary) across products.

My first love at IBM was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)">APL</a>.
I was not the first cost engineer to embrace it, but quickly converted all my work to use it.
IBM professional employees in Endicott, at least, were nearly all still submitting programming by coding sheets.
Since my handwriting is mostly illegible even to me, that was doomed,
but in my building only some executive secretaries had access to display terminals.
APL is such a wonderfully terse language (a single line can do more than a page of Cobol, Fortran or Basic)
that my miserable typing skills were scarcely an impediment.  I soon obtained my own <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102696478">APL Selectric typeball</a>
and monopolized a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_2741">noisy 2741</a> to the extent that I was relocated from the cost engineering bullpen
to an isolated corner office, overlooking North and McKinley:
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@42.1052383,-76.0447717,3a,75y,14.74h,87.7t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sfVzY7pSyKnNhWyjZQvnT_Q!2e0!7i16384!8i8192"><img width=90% src=orifice.jpg></a>

We had rented a house within walking distance of IBM;  weather was typically poor enough
that I would enter at the diagonally opposite (<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/98+N+Adams+Ave,+Endicott,+NY+13760/@42.1073212,-76.0443284,816m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x0:0xdf7c34589664831b!2sIBM+Endicott!8m2!3d42.1043219!4d-76.044491!3m4!1s0x89daecf44f2d554f:0x9d085dde991ac47a!8m2!3d42.1090114!4d-76.0426723">N Adams and Watson</a>) corner of connected buildings.
Coincidentally, this meant that I would regularly pass by the area building my assigned products.
It eventually came out that I was the only cost engineering employee,
except for a couple of old-timers who actually did time-motion,
who knew where their products were being assembled.

<a name="1"><b>Joe Who</b></a>
At IBM, I worked only in cost engineering, then product assurance.
Our experience rather different from typical directs
working in manufacturing, research, development, service, sales or marketing;
we relatively frequent had visitors from headquarters staff.  For example,
product assurance management reported to division, not site managers.
On his second or third visit from headquarters, one cornered me to explain
that some senior executive had lost a son (Vietnam?) and wanted to act as patron to some likely guy.
This totally freaked me, and was my first conscious experience of what I call an <a href="./me.htm#PT">inflection point</a>.
Had I been savvy and sanguine, I might have leveraged that into retirement as an IBM VP or so...
Meanwhile, it soon became evident that managers were quickly rotated thru these areas of regular HQ attention.
It would be years before I heard the phrase "designated executive potential", but much sooner began to recognize the type.
Alternating with career drones who more or less focussed on work would be these clean cut white types who wear suits well.
My first was <i>Joe Who</i>.   Joe had some last name, but I never caught it during the brief time he was our manager.
At least weekly, some stranger would come by asking for Joe.  Coming out of some coding meditation, I would say "Joe Who?"
.. and I was not the only one.  Thing was, Joe <i>did not look like</i> any regular Joe, and spent nearly no time in our area.
