<h3>IBM</h3>
<pre>
My "defense" contractor "career" ended after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Linebacker_II">Christmas bombing</a>, which meant that
I had to attend Signal Corps Officer Basic Training, near Augusta GA,
after which Hazeltine expected me to deploy to Turkey, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_invasion_of_Cyprus">which was preparing to invade Cyprus</a>,
while also sending contractor support to Greece.  This struck me as <i>a really bad idea</i>,
but a college friend already working for IBM finagled me interviews in Endicott.
Since my officer basic <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/101#22">active duty for training</a> occurred before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Saigon">Fall of Saigon</a>,
I may, in theory, be <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2004-title5-vol1/pdf/CFR-2004-title5-vol1-sec307-103.pdf">a Vietnam veteran</a>..?!

One opening was as a System 370 microcoder, and was shown a row of guys pounding away on keypunches,
while I visualized pencils being ground to stubs.  Another opening was in Cost Engineering,
about which I knew nothing, but that manager was impressive, and engineering is essentially economic deployment of resources,
so this would be a learning experience.  Naturally, that manager vanished within months of my employment.
Having been hired with notably more experience than typical engineering grads, I started as a senior associate
instead of the usual junior associate.  While this meant that the usual 6 month probation was skipped,
it also resulted in my not being promoted until well after relocating to Charlotte.
A more astute IBMer would have known that a promotion could have been negotiated as part of that relocation.
