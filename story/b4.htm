<h3>Before IBM</h3>
<pre>
My younger brother and I were both in the first year of the Vietnam draft lottery;
my number is 23, and they drafted beyond 300.
Regular progress as college undergrads yielded deferrments, but being in graduate school <i>did not</i>.
Transferring draft board from Central to Northern NY delayed things a bit,
and the graduate schood dean promised some political help,
<i>which never happened</i>, so I joined ROTC under a program <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_McNamara">McNamara</a> dreamed up.
Graduate school ROTC meant making up for skipping 4 years of regular undergrad ROTC
by going to basic training the first summer, then ROTC basic the second.
The basic concept for Vietnam-era Army basic training was conditioning draftees to fear sargeants more than being shot.
During the first week, I could mentally calculate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green's_function">Green's function</a> while on guard duty.
By the end of basic training, I had lost most of that year's grad school studies,
as demonstrated in oral comps a week after returning.
The second summer, in ROTC basic, was more nearly like Boy Scout camp.
Be refusing to voluntarily zipline into a pond and being unpersuaded by the batallion commander,
I earned this entry in my records:
".. with his present attitude, Cadet Weed is unfit for duty in any military organization."

Regardless, after 2 years of grad school ROTC, I was commissioned,
part of which involved stating that it was "without any mental reservations."
The mental reservation issue was addressed by getting deferred from active duty
by working as a defense contractor.
This involved giving up the fantasy of getting a PhD, becoming a college prof
and spending summers in our MGA at SCCA events and doing research.
