<h3>After IBM</h3>
<h3>merit</h3>
<pre>At an invention recognition event, creation of a <i>career path supposedly parallel</i> to management was announced.
Some seemed mildly shocked that the first Senior Technical Staff promotion went to the development lab manager's son-in-law.
Most subsequent Senior Technical Staff promotions went to managers.</pre>

<pre>My first and last desk job years were spent in large halls
broken up by modular dividers about 120cm high.
Standing up, one could see to all room walls,
with only a few protrusions (e.g. filing cabinets) above those barriers.
Any appreciable disturbance would cause heads to pop up, like gophers.
I had never thought to ask whether cost engineering had been moved to cubicles
in order to accommodate the crush of young boomers IBM employed,
but the ignominious end could be attributed to the same lame CFO (named <a href="https://archive.thinkprogress.org/wealthy-executives-sold-off-equifax-stock-prior-to-data-breach-revelation-9b7e0f72b184/">Gamble</a>..!)
who effectively broke Lexmark during the 2007-8 financial crisis.

My first cube mate was the next most junior department member,
who was hired by Endicott when unable to get in at Boulder,
technical jobs being scarce as Vietnam wound down.
Shortly before being spun out of IBM, I met him again on a trip to Boulder,
still sitting in a cubicle but with a window facing the Rockies.
He had declined promotions to keep that view.

Patient readers may recall <a href="ibm.htm#whine">promotion whining</a>.
I can easily imagine development managers that I had harassed in Charlotte
took satisfaction at Lexmark in assuaging their resentment,
but it was probably also obvious that I found work there sufficiently absorbing
and was highly unlikely to leave after <a href="ibm.htm#rats">declining to join IBM rats abandoning</a>.
Instead of a panoramic Rocky Mountain view, I had settled for looking at my pair of 30 inch Dell monitors.
