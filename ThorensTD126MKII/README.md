[Gallery of rim, belt drive models](https://www.theanalogdept.com/thorens_gallery.htm) TD 150 preceded TD 125  

TD 124 (rim drive liable to vertical rumble) absurdly popular 1957 - 1968  
* Rim drives are liable to rumble, in my experience, and idler wheels replacement is problematic.

TD 125 [mechanically similar to TD 126](https://www.theanalogdept.com/td125_dept.htm) - [chassis comparisons](https://www.theanalogdept.com/rk_125_6_sub-chassis.htm)  
TD 126 (1974) and MK II (1976) models continued to use the 16-pole AC synchronous motor from the TD 125 MK II  
[TD 150, 125 and early 126 use 10mm bearing;  TD 126 MK III and later use 7mm bearing.](https://www.theanalogdept.com/td_platter_bearings.htm)  
"From my taking the bearing off a TD126 Mk2 and replacing it with one off a TD126 Mk3 two differences were noted.  
 Both were 10 mm  The earlier Mk 2 had a one piece bronze sleeve, and metal thrust plate in the bottom.  
 The Mk 3 had a two piece sleeve to allow an oil pressure doughnut half way,  
 ensuring the bottom did not dry out in worst cases of no care.  
 The Mk 3 also had Teflon as the thrust surface."

### Stylus alignment AKA Zenith
Most writing about cartridge alignment is BS.   
First, it is **stylus cantilevers** that want alignment.  
If a stylus is not aligned in its cartridge body, it needs replacing.  
Of course, a (non-conical) needle may be misaligned in its cantiliver...   
Facts:
- For pivoting tonearms, stylus cantilever alignment perfectly tangent to record grooves
  occurs at only 2 places along record radii.
- Audio-Technical writing that different protractors are required for different effective tonearm lengths
  (needle to pivot distance) applies *only* for arc, which does NOT satisfy alignment.
- NOTHING in this diagram is useful for accurate alignment:  
  <img src="https://www.analogplanet.com/images/styles/600_wide/public/0515TAB.jpg">  
- Perfectly matching some overhang or arc is *incidental* to cantilever alignment.  
- These pairs of parallel lines (really, just center lines) are **ALL** that matter for alignment:  
  <a href="http://www.vacuumstate.com/fileupload/Guru_protractor.pdf"><img src="protractor.png"></a>  

IMO, if stylus cantilever cannot be seen well enough to align with protractor, *get another cartridge*.  

Tracking distortion is phase-shifted, compared with harmonic distortion typical of active electronics:  
  <a href="https://www.stereophile.com/reference/arc_angles_optimizing_tonearm_geometry"><img src="https://www.stereophile.com/images/archivesart/310arc.fig4.jpg"></a>
* That phase error should affect perception of stereo imaging..  

Relevant alignment protractor differences are ***only*** about what tracking distortion metric gets minimized:  
* RMS (Loefgren AKA Lofgren B)  
* highest (Baerwald AKA Lofgren A)   
* towards the center(Stevenson)  
  <a href="https://www.analogplanet.com/content/uni-din-versus-l%C3%B6fgren-b-just-clarify"><img src="https://www.analogplanet.com/images/styles/600_wide/public/1114UNI.jpg"></a>
  FWIW, the argument for Stevenson is that classical music typically gets more dynamic towards the center...   

Increasing tonearm length reduces tracking error *magnitude*, but longer arms have higher effective mass,  
which is problematic for high compliance styli and e.g. warped records.
