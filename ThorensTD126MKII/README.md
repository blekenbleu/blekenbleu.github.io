[Gallery of rim, belt drive models](https://www.theanalogdept.com/thorens_gallery.htm) TD 150 preceded TD 125  

TD 124 (rim drive liable to vertical rumble) absurdly popular 1957 - 1968  

TD 125 [mechanically similar to TD 126](https://www.theanalogdept.com/td125_dept.htm) [chassis comparisons](https://www.theanalogdept.com/rk_125_6_sub-chassis.htm)  
TD 126 (1974) and MK II (1976) models continued to use the 16-pole AC synchronous motor from the TD 125 MK II  
[TD 150, 125 and early 126 use 10mm bearing;  TD 126 MK III and later use 7mm bearing.](https://www.theanalogdept.com/td_platter_bearings.htm)  
"From my taking the bearing off a TD126 Mk2 and replacing it with one off a TD126 Mk3 two differences were noted.  
 Both were 10 mm  The earlier Mk 2 had a one piece bronze sleeve, and metal thrust plate in the bottom.  
 The Mk 3 had a two piece sleeve to allow an oil pressure doughnut half way,  
 ensuring the bottom did not dry out in worst cases of no care.  
 The Mk 3 also had Teflon as the thrust surface."
