<h2>LED illumination color rendering meta-analysis</h2><ul compact>
<li>Standards are not created to <i>help</i> consumers;&nbsp standards are for helping <i>sell to</i> consumers
<li>White LED spectral power distributions are not like sunlight:<br><br>
<img src="https://www.knema.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SunLike_03.jpg">
<li>Surfaces with narrow band cyan reflectance appear much darker when illuminated by white LEDs than by sunlight.<br>
Other intensely blue surfaces illuminated by white LEDs appear much brighter than by sunlight.<br>
Those are examples of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamerism_(color)"><i>illuminant metamerism</i></a>
 and poor color rendering.
<li>Incandescent spectral power distribution is <i>also</i> unlike daylight:<br>
<img src="https://www.lightingschool.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/spectral_responses2.png">
<li>However, incandescent visible spectral power approximates that of setting sun:<br>
<img width=75% src="blue-sky-vs-sunset.jpg">
<li>Readers should have noticed that <b>Blue Sky</b> plot, immediately above,<br>
 is considerably less smooth than previous <b>Daylight</b> graph.<ul compact>
<li>perhaps <b>Daylight</b> is merely some illustrative example?
<li>likely measured using a broader filter with logarithmic scale.
</ul>  
<li>Despite notorious difficulties distinguishing dark blue from black,<br>
incandescent illumination obtains a CRI of 100.&nbsp That may have promoted light bulb sales,<br>
but demonstrates limitations of <i>industry standards</i>.
<li>Halogen lamps, which are far better for sorting colors and approximating daylight, have lower CRI (around 95).
<li>LED illumination rendered the fraud that is CRI increasingly untenable.
<li>Researchers are fond of proposing new standards,
presenting data in favorable ways.
<li>Like most industries, illumination manufacturers can be predicted to resist having products evaluated on merit,<br>
with their lobbyists no doubt warning politicians against confusing voters with useful information.<br>
Most standards organizations are substantially driven by industry representatives...

<h3>CCT vs CRI vs CQS vs CFI vs TLCI</h3><dl>
<dt><b>CCT</b>
<dd>Color temperature supposes that illumination source colors are on the one-dimensional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planckian_locus">Plankian locus</a>,<br>
 which is nearly true for incandescent lamps.<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlated_color_temperature">Correlated color temperature</a> attempts to estimate where real 3-diminsional light source might be on that locus.<br>
CCT is no predictor of ability to sort colors.
<dt><b>CRI</b>
<dd><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_rendering_index">Color Rendering Index</a> crudely estimates how nearly illumination matches incandescent, averaging errors.<br>
<a href="https://www.flexfireleds.com/color-rendering-index-cri-and-led-lighting-what-is-cri/">This page</a> demonstrates how badly an illuminant which does moderately well on CRI's 8 colorants can fail.<br>
<a href="https://www.led-professional.com/resources-1/articles/tm-30-or-the-quest-for-new-metrics-to-measure-light-color-quality">This page</a> nicely illustrates inconsistency between CRI's Plankian locus and daylight:<br>
<img width=75% src="https://www.led-professional.com/media/resources-1_articles_tm-30-or-the-quest-for-new-metrics-to-measure-light-color-quality_screen-shot-2016-08-11-at-15-49-39.png/@@images/6220369a-f2a9-4f65-bc4e-6655434fa1cb.png">

<dt><b>CQS</b>
<dd><a href="https://www.nist.gov/publications/rationale-color-quality-scale">Color Quality Scale</a>
was a U.S. national standards body attempt to <a href="https://www.nist.gov/pml/sensor-science/optical-radiation/color-rendering-light-sources">improve on CRI</a>.<br>
An analogy would be attempting to chrome plate a pig, instead of merely applying lipstick.<br>
<a href="https://www.candlepowerforums.com/threads/cri-vs-alternatives-with-measurement-examples.415041/">This page</a> IMO nicely compares CRI and CQS, with values for some flashlight LEDs.<br>
Despite <a href="https://tachyonlight.com/comparative-analysis-of-cqs-and-cri/">CQS merits</a>, standards proposed by a country using pounds, yards, gallons and Fahrenheit are doomed.

<dt><b>CFI</b>
<dd>Color Fidelity Index is derived from <a href="https://www.ies.org/advocacy/position-statements/ps-11-18-ies-position-on-tm-30-18-ies-method-for-evaluating-light-source-color-rendition/">IES TM-30-18</a>.&nbsp <br>
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/ssl/color-rendition">This U.S. DoE page</a> evaluates TM-30 with problematic illuminants, proposing metamerism predictors.<br>
While not helping understand how CFI rates real LEDs, it does indirectly link <a href="https://spectralcalculator.pnnl.gov/calculator">an <b>Online Spectral Calculator</b></a>:<br>
<iframe align=center width="960" height="640" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/euNT-efY-lE"></iframe><br>
<a href="https://www.flexfireleds.com/what-is-tm-30-15-and-cri-and-cqs">This page</a> illustrates using CRI vs CFI's 99 color samples,
 but promotes CRI extended to 15 colorants.<br>
<a href="https://www.stellarnet.us/a-new-color-fidelity-index-for-led-and-light-measurement-tm-30-15/">Standardized targets with 99 stable colorants</a> will not be cheap.

<dt><b>TLCI</b>
<dd><a href="https://tech.ebu.ch/tlci-2012">TELEVISION LIGHTING CONSISTENCY INDEX</a> makes sense with video substantially replacing print.<br>
However, researchers prefer to publish, and humans resist be sensible.<br> <a href="">This page</a> reports that actual CRI, CQS, CFI and TLCI measurements generally correlate,<br>
but emphasizes that TLCI was designed around how camera’s respond to light, which would be actually useful.<br>
Getting anyone other than <a href="https://indiecinemaacademy.com/complete-led-color-database-cri-tlci-cqs-tm30-15/">specialized light suppliers</a> to actually use it seems highly unlikely...
