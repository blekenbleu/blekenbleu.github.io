<h4>Alternatives</h4>
Several NAS vendors besides Synology and Buffalo include
QNAP, Asustor, TerraMaster, WD,<br> and their products get higher ratings than Synology in some tests,<br>
but some of those articles then suggest replacing their proprietary NAS OS with e.g. FreeNAS or TrueNAS.<br>
Perhaps those may be nearly turn-key, but my Linux distro experience does not encourage that expectation.

 I had been unclear about using BTRFS filesystem, but it's really cool and recommended.<br>
 When you do, make sure you have the checksum box checked otherwise you won't be able to do a data scrub<br>
 which will help fix any data bits from flipping (data rot)(also, you cannot turn checksum on after the fact.<br>
 You would need to create a new shared folder and start from scratch.<br>
 Also, I initially was getting fairly slow transfer speeds when moving my data over to this new box,<br>
 but again I found a video that suggested I uncheck "enable memory compression".<br>
 Once unchecked, I got full gigabit transfer rates.

<h3>Hard drive reliability:&nbsp 1.54% annualized failure rate, per <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/b2/hard-drive-test-data.html">Backblaze</a></h3>
For 4 drives, that translates to 22% likelihood at least one will fail within 4 years;<br>
this encourages sacrificing one for protection, AKA RAID 5 or Synology SHR 1.
<h4><a href="https://www.wundertech.net/synology-raid-calculator-shr-vs-raid/">Synology RAID Calculator: SHR vs. RAID</a></h4>
 SHR compares somewhat to RAID 5:
 <li>if all drives are the same size, one gets used for protection
 <li>if one is larger, the amount by which it is larger than the smallest (RAID 5) or next largest (SHR) gets wasted
 <li>if one is smaller, that size is the only amount used from each drive by RAID 5
 <li>SHR protection size is lesser of 2 largest drives.

There are really no other tests other then S.M.A.R.T.,<br>
which won't catch mechanical problems for instance.<br>
The Storage Manager will show the SMART status of each disk.<br>

<i>2 Jun 2023</i>:<br>
Received wrapped in heavy plastic bag inside form-fitting foam.&nbsp
Battery initially reported 100% capacity,<br> but quickly dropped to 73% when unplugged with 23 Watt load (Nikon microscope illuminator).<br>
Alarm is neither loud nor constant;&nbsp unlikely to be heard from another room...<br>
After allowing it to fully recharge, battery cap immediately dropped to 61% after unplugging with the same load.<br><br>

Sadly, outlets are oriented wrong for my router, modem and MoCA bridge wall warts, complicating connections:<br>
