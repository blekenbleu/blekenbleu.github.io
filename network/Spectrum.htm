<h3>Spectrum Cable Modem and WiFi Router 6 downgrades 
</h3> 
Spectrum notified us of a free Internet speed increase to 500Mbps
(from 300), requiring a new Hitron EN2251 cable modem.<br>
Delivered promptly, the <a href="https://us.hitrontech.com/products/service-providers/en2251-cable-modem/">Hitron EN2251</a> is unexpectedly bulkier
than its nominally slower predecessor.<br>
<li>DOCSIS 3.1 2x2 multi-carrier OFDM
<li>DOCSIS 3.0 32x8 channel bonding
<li>Fixed 5-85 MHz upstream
<li>Built-in MoCA immunity filter
<li>2.5 Gbps LAN port<br>
The predecessor Arris TM1602 was DOCSIS 3.0 16x4.<br>
Its status could be checked at <a href="http://192.168.100.1">192.168.100.1</a><br>
That was handy for verifying when Spectrum cable service failed.<br>
Unlike that modem, the EN2251 lacks HTTP admin/status...<br>
<br>
Speeds are not measured at a direct cat 6 ethernet connection to the router,<br>
instead via MoCA (multimedia over cable),<br>
with a <a href="https://mans.io/files/fullviewer/2195904">goC0ax WF-803M MoCA 2.5Gbps modem</a>
 signalling back over the same coax<br> feeding Spectrum's
cable modem to a MoCA splitter at the cable entrance box<br>
and then back into the house over coax to the far end of the house<br>
for another WF-803M feeding my i7-8700K Windows 10 PC by ethernet.<br>

Instead of providing a return label,
Spectrum wants the modem brought to a UPS store.<br>
On 4 sites tested, the new modem shows improvement on only <a href="https://openspeedtest.com/"><b>HTML5</b></a>,<br>
which also yields most variable results when run repeatedly...<br>
<br>
Overall, a waste of time, particularly since the more useful Arris TM1602 must be trundled to UPS for return to Spectrum.<br>

<h3>Spectrum's Sagemcom F@ST 5260 router crash</h3>
Spectrum Internet conked out;&nbsp
no longer subscribed for cable TV;&nbsp
no easy check whether a Spectrum cable problem.<br>
"Upgraded" modem no longer shows an Internet status page.&nbsp
When Internet crapped out weeks ago,<br> restarting modem did not help.&nbsp
Router seemed OK, but Internet was recovered (hours later) by restarting it.<br><br>

Weeks later, Internet crapped out again;&nbsp pretty clearly a router issue,
since router would not display its login page.&nbsp
Powered it off, then on;&nbsp Internet eventually came back briefly,
but router login page did not display.<br>
Unplugged it and plugged in an old Cisco router,
but it could not connect to Spectrum's cable modem.&nbsp
Replugged Spectrum's Sagemcom F@ST 5260 router,
which came up and works,
except admin password was reset to default.&nbsp
<li>perhaps because Spectrum automagically resets it remotely
  if e.g. a (wrong) router issue is detected
<li>perhaps the router has been hacked...<br>
I considered checking with Spectrum support by chat,
  but decided that I had already enough hassle for one day.<br><br>

iPhone by cellular is unreliable here;&nbsp Internet recovery gets problematic.
<h4>heavy sigh</h4>
When it quit again 5 hours later, I got on chat with a Spectrum rep,
who agreed that router needed replacing.<br>
That required visiting their Hilton Head store, about 45 minutes away.<br>
The store's website encouraged making an appointment:&nbsp  11:45 today.<br>
Traffic from Sun City to Hilton Head recalls
Mad Max movies except with lamer plot, driving and special effects.<br>
Contrary to website, store had no provision for appointment check in,
waited while multiple women freaked about possibly being without
their phone number for a day while switching carriers.<br>  Nearly an hour later,
my router swap took 3 minutes;&nbsp a long line was queued by then.<br>
<br>
The new router came with absolutely no documentation;&nbsp
<a href=https://manuals.plus/spectrum/spectrum-wifi-6-router-manual-2>QR code</a>
directed to a wrong website.<br>
Not only does new router lack USB, it also lacks any local management,
and only a little by smartphone app.<br>
No way to know whether Wi-Fi devices are using 2.4 or 5GHz.
Most attached devices list only MAC address,<br>
which is useless for access by humans using web browser or <code>ping</code>.<br>
Despite using the same 192.168.1.0 LAN address,
all 22 attached devices got new addresses.<br>
No means to port DHCP address reservations from the old router...<br>
Sorting new addresses took most of the afternoon,
since cached browser passwords were for now obsolete addresses.<br>
Two MoCA bridges reported devices attached to them.<br>
Before an SSD USB drive on the failed Spectrum router,
a <a href=LinkStation.htm>Buffalo LinkStation 210 fileserver</a> was used:<br>
<embed width=100% src=https://www.buffalotech.com/images/about_buffalo/LS210D_Datasheet_English.pdf>
... but LinkStation address is not found after plugging it to the new router,
MoCA bridge attachment is <a href=LinkStation.htm>for tomorrow</a>.<br>
<br>
We have a choice between Spectrum and Hargrave for cable ISP;&nbsp
if their equipment still supports local management,
Hargrave might be tempting.<br>
