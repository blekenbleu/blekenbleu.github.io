Network-attached storage is not a tricky concept, but <i>major</i> BS accompanies it.<br>
Contrary to braying about various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID">RAID strategies</a>,<br>
most frequent failures IME can be blamed on proprietary firmware and obscure filesystem formats.<br>
<b>This relative reliability disparity should be increasingly true with Solid State Drives in SANs.</b><br>
Ideally, NAS would support <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/ssd-file-system-ntfs,3166-11.html">exFAT drives</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Living_Network_Alliance">DLNA</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block">SMB</a>.&nbsp
Those are supported by Linux, Windows and MacOS.<br>  Supporting more simply complicates demonstrably fragile NAS firmware.&nbsp
If/when NAS devices fail,<br> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExFAT">exFAT</a> drives could be extricated and externally attached to PCs by USB adapters.<br>

<i>Meanwhile</i>...<br><br>

<a href="https://buffalotech.com/support/downloads/linkstation-200-series">NAS Navigator 2</a> discovered the LinkStation:<br>
<img src=Emergency.png><br clear=all>
Floundered around in NAS Navigator, not finding any explanation for Emergency Mode
until a brief pop-up mention firmware update.<br>
<a href=update.html>Firmware update documentation</a> was aware of "EM Mode";<br>
those instructions include, without explaining how to detect time out:<ul compact>
<li>Do not turn the unit or the hub off until the update is finished.
<li>The update will take several minutes. If it times out after 10 minutes or more, reboot the LinkStation and try again.
<br>Note: If your LinkStation is in EM mode, reboot it and try again.</ul>
Fortunately, firmware did update, eventually, without timing out:<br><img src=LS210D15D.png><br clear=all><br>

... and perhaps best from Buffalo:&nbsp <a href="http://en.faq.buffalo-global.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/10330/p/31,33,6478,6481">I can not access LinkStation; "EM"</a>
<li>Cause: It is in the EM mode (emergency mode) because of the damage in the firmware.
<li>Countermeasure: Update the firmware<br><br>

Consensus is that LinkStation has firmware (in flash?) for responding to NAS Navigator application<br> and loading NAS firmware <i>to the hard drive</i>,
but eventually fails to read that firmware correctly, so either:
<li>hard drive is failing
<li>firmware writes over its filesystem image<br><br>

If the latter, that may be a result of e.g. failing power supply (filter capacitor?) causing code to space shot.<br>
Today's failure to respond until ethernet was disconnected and reconnected suggests code issues.<br>
In either case (crap hardware or firmware), LinkStation is a poor choice for robust NAS, and<br>
<b>a far less pessimistic owner than I is wanted to continue attempting to use it.</b>
