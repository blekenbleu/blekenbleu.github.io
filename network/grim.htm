<h3>Synology DSM 7.2 (grim) reality</h3><dl compact>
<dt><b>DSM Demo</b> &nbsp <i>2 Jun 2023</i>
<dd>If this is at all representative, managing a Synology NAS will be unpleasant to impossible<ul>
<li> <b>SDSM Online Demo</b> <a href=https://demo.synology.com/en-us/dsm>link</a><br>
For example, <i>More info</i> for DSM Help in <code>Stay ahead of problems > System monitoring</code><br> simply dumps user to generic Synology Knowledge Center
<li>searching <b>system monitoring</b> has no useful hits in <b>Synology Knowledge Center</b>
<li><b>Active Insight</b> has some hits, but why a BS name and inconsistent terminology?<br>
The evident answer:&nbsp <b>Active Insight</b> is a coyly obscured paid service.<br>
That this trap is their first configuration option preempts credibility for subsequent options.
<li>How many DSM so-called features are money grabbing honey pots?
<li>Regardless, this "Demo" eventually pops up a login screen, which fails for my Synology userid and password;<br>
<i>this "Demo" itself is seemingly also a paid option;&nbsp effectively a masochism filter.</i><br>
How much extra will victims pay for hassle and abuse lacking real utility?
</ul>
<dt><br><i>received 3 Jun 2023</i>
<dd>Marks visible in eBay images are gouges in plastic<br>
Drives are 4TB Seagate IronWolf NAS.<br>
DS920+ powered up immediately when power was applied, not waiting for power button press.<br>
Spectrum notified iPhone of new network device...<br>
Powered off after using <a href="https://finds.synology.com/">https://finds.synology.com/</a> to install Sansung 4GB SODIMM:<br>
<img width=90% src="SODIMM4GB.jpg">
<dt><br>DS920+ installed with other LAN gear, powered thru UPC:
<dd><img width=90% src=LAN_NAS.jpg>
<dt><br>DS920+ required power button press to restart after memory upgrade.
<dd>Must check <code>[v] I understand</code> to <font color=red>Continue</font> DSM installation.<br>
Web page counts down 10 minutes or so for DSM and built-in packages installation and restart.
<dt>memory upgrade from 4 to 8GB success:
<dd><img width=90% src=GeneralInfo.png>
<dt>Initial installation is mostly reasonably straight-forward
<dt>Gmail system notifications enabled, prompted by <code>Enable email notification</code> for package updates
<dd>but Package Center settings then refused to save until <code>Don't Save</code>, then set again...<br>
<dt>again with the nebulous <b>Active Insight</b>
<dd>Completely unobvious whether it actually has value for a home user with single NAS,<br>
given other email, smartphone and <a href="https://notification.synology.com/web/#/pair/chrome">web notification</a> facilities...
<dt>Configure QuickConnect
<dd><img width=90% src=QuickConnect.png>
<dt>Storage Pool, Drive selection and Volume settings could seemingly be consolidated
<dd><img width=90% src=StoragePool.png>
<dd><img width=90% src=SelectDrives.png>
<dt><br>Why anything other than <code>Max</code> volume capacity <i>wants explaining</i>
<dd><img width=90% src=Volume.png>
<dd><img width=90% src=ConfirmStorage.png>
<dd><br>Sent an initial Health Drive email report, not very informative:&nbsp <code>No problem detected with the drives in DSM</code><br>
Detailed S.M.A.R.T. information seems <a href="https://kb.synology.com/en-global/DSM/help/DSM/StorageManager/disk?version=7#Analytics">gratuitously hard to obtain</a>
<dt><br>SHR Storage Pool optimization runs in the background, probably takes 10-12 hours
<dd><img width=90% src=BackgroundOptimizing.png>
<dt><br><b>At this point, focussed installation help ends</b>. &nbsp Default packages installed:
<dd><img width=90% src=DefaultPackages.png>
<dd><br>Other packages installed:
<li>exFAT Access
<li>Text Editor
<dt>2-factor DSM admin sign-in using smartphone
<dd>baffling <a href="https://kb.synology.com/en-us/DSM/tutorial/OTP_packages_supportability"><b>alternative sign-in method</b></a>;&nbsp
less baffling by browser:<br>
<img wide=90% src=backup.png>
<dt><br><b>Yet to do:</b>
<dd>Set up SMB share
