<h3>Synology DSM 7.2 (grim) reality</h3><dl compact>
<dt><b>DSM Demo</b> &nbsp <i>2 Jun 2023</i>
<dd>If this is at all representative, managing a Synology NAS will be unpleasant to impossible<ul>
<li> <b>SDSM Online Demo</b> <a href=https://demo.synology.com/en-us/dsm>link</a><br>
For example, <i>More info</i> for DSM Help in <code>Stay ahead of problems > System monitoring</code><br> simply dumps user to generic Synology Knowledge Center
<li>searching <b>system monitoring</b> has no useful hits in <b>Synology Knowledge Center</b>
<li><b>Active Insight</b> has some hits, but why a BS name and inconsistent terminology?<br>
The evident answer:&nbsp <b>Active Insight</b> is a coyly obscured paid service.<br>
That this trap is their first configuration option preempts credibility for subsequent options.
<li>How many DSM so-called features are money grabbing honey pots?
<li>Regardless, this "Demo" eventually pops up a login screen, which fails for my Synology userid and password;<br>
<i>this "Demo" itself is seemingly also a paid option;&nbsp effectively a masochism filter.</i><br>How much extra will victims pay for hassle and abuse lacking real utility?
</ul>
