distinguished from antenna analyzer by having two ports instead of one,<br>
and from scaler analyzer e.g. SWR (Standing Wave Ratio) bridge by sorting resistance vs reactance instead of impedance magnitude.</p>
<p>nanoVNA principles of operation are largely as described in this YouTube video by Michael Knitter DG5MK:<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Z7veGV57o">Hamradio 2018 FA-VA5 presentation-UK</a>
<br>Instead of SA612 mixer
 (also used by <a href="https://bitbucket.org/kuchura/eu1ky_aa_v3/wiki/Home">EU1KY analyzer</a>),
 the FA-VA5 uses 74LVC4066 analog switches.<br>
While analog switch ICs have better linearity, dynamic range and GHz switch bandwidths,<br>
 switching times tend to be greater than 1ns, limiting local oscillators to 200MHz or so..

<li>Measurement range: 70dB (50kHz-300MHz), 50dB (300M-600MHz), 40dB(600M-900MHz)
<li>Port swr &lt 1.1
<li>Frequency error &lt 0.5ppm</sl>

<p>
nanoVNA begins using the third harmonic, while boosting Si5351 output, when exceeding 300 MHz.<br>
<em>Perhaps,</em> power boost parameters are saved along with other correction factors. 
</p>
<em>thanks to hugen@outlook.com:</em><br>
<p>
The Si5351 internal VCO (Voltage Controlled Oscillator) specified maximum is 900MHz<br>
 for a divide-by-4-frequency output maximum of 225MHz.<br>
To output 300MHz, that VCO is overclocked to 1200MHz, which not every Si5351 can.<br>
Si5351 internal VCO operating frequency limit decreases with increasing temperature.<br>
For significant spike artifacts (&gt0dB) at 300 MHz or 900 MHz, <a href="#F800">800MHz firmware is recommended</a>.
</p>
<b>This suggests that fully enclosed cases, raising component temperatures, may be problematic.</b>
<p>Charging is by USB, which connector is Type C for black nanoVNAs and Micro-USB B for white gekkos.<br>
One LED (between USB and power switch) blinks @ 1/2Hz while charging, then illuminates constantly;<br>
&nbsp - this LED remains on for 40 seconds after USB removal or powering off, <em>perhaps discharging capacitors?</em><br>
Another LED, between power switch and multi-directional switch, illuminates while nanoLED is powered;<br>
&nbsp - this may be vestigal, from early nanoVNA prototypes which lacked LCD displays.</p>

Pressing this launches menu or selects menu item;<br>
nudging left or right migrates among launched menu items or moves selected marker.

<h3>Calibration for 4 track nanoVNA</h3>
<em>thanks to Alan Victor</em>:
<p>
Some notes: If you can have on hand another 50 ohm termination<br>
and another female-female SMA adapter, it is helpful.<br>
<br>
Supplied and used are the TWO- matched cables, the LOADS and one SMA adapter.<br>
Each of the NUMBERED items below represent your PRESS (SOFT KEY TOUCH).<br>
<br>
Turn on the VNA and note register 0 is ON.<br>
CONNECT THE EQUAL LENGTH MALE-to-MALE COAX CABLES TO CH0 AND CH1.<br>
<ol>
<li> DISPLAY
<li> TRACE 0
<li> SINGLE
<li> TRACE 1
<br>
Now we are displaying S11 and S22 ONLY both as LOGMAG.<br>

<li> STIMULUS
<li> START 100 KHz
<li> STOP 500 MHz
<li> BACK
<li> CAL
<li>RESET
<li>CALIBRATE
<br>
Note! None of the softkeys on the right side touch screen are highlighted.<br>
Place an OPEN on end of CH0 cable and this will be followed by a SHORT.<br>

<li>OPEN
<li>SHORT
<br>
Place a 50 ohm LOAD(s) on the end of cables for CH0 and CH1.<br>

<li>LOAD
<li>ISOLN
<br>
Connect the 2-cables together using the female-female SMA adapter.<br>

<li>THRU
<li>DONE
<br>
Finally save to a desired register.<br>
</ol>
That's it. Check and be sure that the open, short and 50 ohm are on the proper
side of the chart.<br>
 Note, the cables are CONNECTED to CH0 and CH1 and the calibration is to the end of the cables.<br>
 The reference plane for insertion loss measure magnitude is in place of the adapter.<br>
 However, the phase is subject to error and that needs addressed in another message.<br>
<br>
Also, with a thru cable connection between CH0 and CH1, the loss measure, S21 should be nearly 0 dB.

<h3 id="TSC">Touchscreen Calibration</h3>
<em> thanks to Larry Rothman</em>:
<p>
For best behavior, nanoVNA devices need touchscreen calibraton,<br>
which requires connection via its USB serial interface to your PC/MAC/Terminal.<br>
<ol compact><li>install <a href="https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-stm32102.html">STM USB drivers</a>, if required.
<li>connect the nanoVNA and determine which serial port has been assigned (e.g. COM5)
<li>use a serial terminal emulator such as TeraTerm to access the nanoVNA console.
<li>you may need to hit the ENTER key once or twice to bring up its command shell prompt.
<li>at the command prompt, enter:  touchcal
<li>the nanoVNA should now display a calibration point at the upper-left corner of the display.  
<li>touch that corner - a new calibration point will appear at the lower right corner of the display.
<li>touch that corner - the screen is now calibrated - <b>BUT NOT SAVED</b>
</ol>
<dl compact><dt><b>touchcal</b>
<dd>- produces calibration touch points in the upper left and lower right corners<br>
     outputs: "first touch upper left, then lower right..."<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  "done"<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  "touch cal params: A B C D (upper left and lower right x-y co-ords)"</dd>
<dt><b>touchtest</b></dt><dd> - test touch accuracy - touch, hold and drag pointer</dd></dl>
<h4>Now, save this touchscreen calibration:</h4>
&nbsp At the command prompt, enter <b>saveconfig</b>
<ul compact><li><b>saveconfig</b> - saves current configuration - outputs "Config saved"</li></ul>
You can verify touch calibration using the menu boxes.<br>
<br>
<b>NOTE</b>: at this time, it is not known what else the saveconfig command saves besides touchscreen calibration.

Numerical input seems a bit flaky, although it works better for e.g. CW frequency than position.<br>
Touchscreen calibration typically wants <a href="">calibration</a><br>
Font larger with antenna analyser firmware making touchscreen [mis]calibration more critical on others..<br>

Numeric entry displays no decimal point, but one may be implied. eg:<ul compact><li>When in logmag reference adjust mode,
 digits appear to represent steps of 0.01dB,<br> so a change of +1000 moves the reference 10dB higher.
<li>In CW Freq setting, digits seem to represent steps of 100Hz.</ul>
<dl><dt>
Rocker switch input
<dd>
Tapping on a digit makes it adjustable; step it up or down using the multi-directional switch.<br>
 If you hold the multi-directional switch in, that digit is 'highlighted' and its background goes black.<br>
 The multi-directional switch can be used to shift highlighting to another digit.<br>
 Press in again, highlighting disappears and the digit becomes adjustable.<br>
 Once set, briefly pressing the multi-directional switch in stores that numerical setting.<br>
 <b>NB</b> It appears that you need to wait a few seconds between presses on the rocker switch or it ignores the input.

<dt>Touchscreen input
<dd>
Tapping far right of numbers brings up a numeric keyboard.<br>
This keyboard may be operated either by touchscreen taps or by multi-directional switch movements.<br>
 ( With 2-trace 900MHz antenna analyser firmware, multi-directional switch movements seem buggy.<br>
&nbsp In reference position adjust mode, the 'enter' button doesn't seem to do anything<br>
&nbsp but if it is held the keyboard clears from the screen.<br>
&nbsp The keyboard works fine when setting e.g. CW Freq.<br>
&nbsp Frequencies may be entered as GHz, MHz or kHz;<br>
&nbsp just enter the digits then tap G, M or k to enter the set value.<br>
&nbsp (eg to set 800 MHz you can enter 0.8G, 800M or 800000k.)

<dl>
<dt>for e.g. LOGMAG</dt>
<dd>An entry of 1-8 (0001 to 0008) places the REFERENCE line 1 to 8 grid spaces from the BOTTOM.<br>
  An entry of 8 places the reference trace location to the very TOP of the screen.<br><br>
  With default setting 7 000, changing it to 8 000 moves the trace reference<br>
 (shown by a small marker at left of screen) up one grid space, to screen top.</dd>

This button freezes data collection.<br>
<br><em>thanks to Gary O'Neil</em>:
<p>
The nanoVNA must remain powered on at all times to work successfully capture data via USB.<br>
<ol compact>
<li> With the data you wish to "save" and port to your remotely located workstation,<br>
 navigate to STIMULUS > PAUSE SWEEP. Data at the top of the screen will freeze, confirming sweep is paused.

<li> Take care to not inadvertently alter the current state...<br>
 either by the toggle switch or touchscreen.<br>
 Remove the NanoVNA from the DUT,<br> observe that the desired data remains on the display,<br>
 transport it to your workstation, hotplug the device into a USB port,<br>
 then tap on the display a couple of times.
<br> This appears to initiate handshaking and establishes its connection with the workstation.

<li> Launch the nanoVNAsharp app and connect.<br>

App display should match that on the nanoVNA.
<li>Use nanoVNAsharp facilities to save the data. 
</ol>
To be clear, data is <em>not</em> otherwise saved within the NanoVNA.<br>
Once PAUSE is cancelled or the nanoVNA is power cycled, data is flushed and replaced.</p>
